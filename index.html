infrastructure, and silent, long-duration breaches that bypass traditional defenses. the f5 breach highlights long-term, stealthy nation-state attacks on edge infrastructure. linkpro rootkit demonstrates the evolution of linux-based backdoors using ebpf and magic packets to evade detection. etherhiding represents a novel use of blockchain for malware distribution by north korean actors. pixnapping is a side-channel attack on android devices that steals 2fa codes and sensitive data. zero disco exploits a known vulnerability in cisco ios to deploy rootkits. all incidents underscore the

It performs system reconnaissance, escalates privileges, and deploys RMM tools (e.g., AnyDesk, ScreenConnect, GoToDesk) for lateral movement. To evade detection, it disables AMSI, disables TLS certificate validation, and uses Cobalt Strike and SystemBC for persistence. The ransomware encrypts files, wipes event logs, and deletes shadow copies.
