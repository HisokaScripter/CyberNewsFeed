Neursite enables system information gathering, process management, and traffic proxying, while NeuralExecutor fetches C2 addresses from a GitHub repository, using it as a dead drop. The campaign leverages already compromised internal servers as C2 infrastructure and employs plugin-based architecture for dynamic functionality.

Additional entries include CVE-2025-33073 (Microsoft SMB privilege escalation, fixed June 2025), CVE-2025-2746 and CVE-2025-2747 (Kentico CMS authentication bypasses, fixed March 2025), and CVE-2022-48503 (Apple JavaScriptCore arbitrary code execution, fixed July 2022).
