The threat actors behind a large-scale, ongoing smishing campaign have been attributed to more than 194,000 malicious domains since January 1, 2024, targeting a broad range of services across the world, according to new findings from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42.
&quot;Although these domains are registered through a Hong Kong-based registrar and use Chinese nameservers, the attack infrastructure is primarily hosted on popular U.S. cloud services,&quot; security researchers Reethika Ramesh, Zhanhao Chen, Daiping Liu, Chi-Wei Liu, Shehroze Farooqi, and Moe Ghasemisharif said .
The activity has been attributed to a China-linked group known as the Smishing Triad , which is known to flood mobile devices with fraudulent toll violation and package misdelivery notices to trick users into taking immediate action and providing sensitive information.
These campaigns have proven to be lucrative, allowing the threat actors to make more than $1 billion over the last three years, according to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal.
In a report published earlier this week, Fortra said phishing kits associated with the Smishing Triad are being used to increasingly target brokerage accounts to obtain banking credentials and authentication codes, with attacks targeting these accounts witnessing a fivefold jump in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.
&quot;Once compromised, attackers manipulate stock market prices using &#x27;ramp and dump&#x27; tactics,&quot; security researcher Alexis Ober said . &quot;These methods leave almost no paper trail, further heightening the financial risks that arise from this threat.&quot;
The adversarial collective is said to have evolved from a dedicated phishing kit purveyor into a &quot;highly active community&quot; that brings together disparate threat actors, each of whom plays a crucial role in the phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) ecosystem.
This includes phishing kit developers, data brokers (who sell target phone numbers), domain sellers (who register disposable domains for hosting the phishing sites), hosting providers (who provide servers), spammers (who deliver the messages to victims at scale), liveness scanners (who validate phone numbers), and blocklist scanners (who check the phishing domains against known blocklists for rotation).
Unit 42&#x27;s analysis has revealed that nearly 93,200 of the 136,933 root domains (68.06%) are registered under Dominet (HK) Limited, a registrar based in Hong Kong. Domains with the prefix &quot;com&quot; account for a significant majority, although there has been an increase in the registration of &quot;gov&quot; domains in the past three months.
Of the identified domains, 39,964 (29.19%) were active for two days or less, 71.3% of them were active for less than a week, 82.6% of them were active for two weeks or less, and less than 6% had a lifespan beyond the first three months of their registration.
&quot;This rapid churn clearly demonstrates that the campaign&#x27;s strategy relies on a continuous cycle of newly registered domains to evade detection,&quot; the cybersecurity company noted, adding the 194,345 fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) used in the resolve to as many as 43,494 unique IP addresses, most of which are in the U.S. and hosted on Cloudflare ( AS13335 ).
Some of the other salient aspects of the infrastructure analysis are below -
In phishing campaigns impersonating government services, users are often redirected to landing pages that claim unpaid toll and other service charges, in some cases even leveraging ClickFix lures to trick them into running malicious code under the pretext of completing a CAPTCHA check.
&quot;The smishing campaign impersonating U.S. toll services is not isolated,&quot; Unit 42 said. &quot;It is instead a large-scale campaign with global reach, impersonating many services across different sectors. The threat is highly decentralized. Attackers are registering and churning through thousands of domains daily.&quot;

Microsoft on Thursday released out-of-band security updates to patch a critical-severity Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) vulnerability with a proof-of-concept (Poc) exploit publicly available and has come under active exploitation in the wild.
The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-59287 (CVSS score: 9.8), a remote code execution flaw in WSUS that was originally fixed by the tech giant as part of its Patch Tuesday update published last week.
Three security researchers, MEOW, f7d8c52bec79e42795cf15888b85cbad, and Markus Wulftange with CODE WHITE GmbH, have been acknowledged for discovering and reporting the bug.
The shortcoming concerns a case of deserialization of untrusted data in WSUS that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network. It&#x27;s worth noting that the vulnerability does not impact Windows servers that do not have the WSUS Server Role enabled.
In a hypothetical attack scenario, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could send a crafted event that triggers unsafe object deserialization in a &quot;legacy serialization mechanism,&quot; leading to remote code execution.
According to HawkTrace security researcher Batuhan Er , the issue &quot;arises from the unsafe deserialization of AuthorizationCookie objects sent to the GetCookie() endpoint, where encrypted cookie data is decrypted using AES-128-CBC and subsequently deserialized through BinaryFormatter without proper type validation, enabling remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.&quot;
It&#x27;s worth noting that Microsoft itself previously recommended developers to stop using BinaryFormatter for deserialization, owing to the fact that the method is not safe when used with untrusted input. An implementation of BinaryFormatter was subsequently removed from .NET 9 in August 2024.
&quot;To comprehensively address CVE-2025-59287, Microsoft has released an out of band security update for the following supported versions of Windows Server: Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2022, 23H2 Edition (Server Core installation), and Windows Server 2025,&quot; Redmond said in an update.
Once the patch is installed, it&#x27;s advised to perform a system reboot for the update to take effect. If applying the out-of-band is not an option, users can take any of the following actions to protect against the flaw -
&quot;Do NOT undo either of these workarounds until after you have installed the update,&quot; Microsoft warned.
The development comes as the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it learned from a &quot;trusted partner that abuse of CVE-2025-59287 was observed on October 24, 2025.&quot;
Eye Security, which notified NCSC-NL of the in-the-wild exploitation, said it first observed the vulnerability being abused at 06:55 a.m. UTC to drop a Base64-encoded payload targeting an unnamed customer. The payload, a .NET executable, &quot;takes the value &#x27;aaaa&#x27; request header and runs it directly using cmd.exe.&quot;
&quot;This is the payload that is being sent to servers, which uses the request header with the name &#x27;aaaa&#x27; as a source for the command that is to be executed,&quot; Piet Kerkhofs, CTO of Eye Security, told The Hacker News. &quot;This avoids commands appearing directly in the log.&quot;
Asked if the exploitation could have occurred earlier than today, Kerkhofs pointed out that the &quot;PoC by HawkTrace was released two days ago, and it can use a standard ysoserial .NET payload, so yes, the pieces for exploitation were there.&quot;
Cybersecurity firm Huntress also said it detected threat actors targeting WSUS instances publicly exposed on their default ports (8530/TCP and 8531/TCP) starting around 2025-10-23 23:34 UTC. However, it noted that the exploitation of CVE-2025-59287 is likely to be limited, given that WSUS is not often exposing ports 8530 and 8531.
&quot;Attackers leveraged exposed WSUS endpoints to send specially crafted requests (multiple POST calls to WSUS web services) that triggered a deserialization RCE against the update service,&quot; it said .
The exploit activity has resulted in the WSUS worker process spawning &quot;cmd.exe&quot; and PowerShell instances, leading to the download and execution of a Base64-encoded PowerShell payload with the goal of enumerating exposed servers for network and user information and exfiltrating the results to an attacker-controlled webhook[.]site URL.
When reached for comment, a Microsoft spokesperson told the publication that &quot;We re-released this CVE after identifying that the initial update did not fully mitigate the issue. Customers who have installed the latest updates are already protected.&quot;
The company also emphasized that the issue does not affect servers that don&#x27;t have WSUS Server Role enabled and has recommended impacted customers to follow the guidance on its CVE page .
Given the availability of a PoC exploit and detected exploitation activity, it&#x27;s essential that users apply the patch as soon as possible to mitigate the threat. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has also added the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, requiring federal agencies to remediate it by November 14, 2025.

A Pakistan-nexus threat actor has been observed targeting Indian government entities as part of spear-phishing attacks designed to deliver a Golang-based malware known as DeskRAT .
The activity, observed in August and September 2025 by Sekoia, has been attributed to Transparent Tribe (aka APT36), a state-sponsored hacking group known to be active since at least 2013. It also builds upon a prior campaign disclosed by CYFIRMA in August 2025.
The attack chains involve sending phishing emails containing a ZIP file attachment, or in some cases, a link pointing to an archive hosted on legitimate cloud services like Google Drive. Present within the ZIP file is a malicious Desktop file embedding commands to display a decoy PDF (&quot;CDS_Directive_Armed_Forces.pdf&quot;) using Mozilla Firefox while simultaneously executing the main payload.
Both the artifacts are pulled from an external server &quot;modgovindia[.]com&quot; and executed. Like before, the campaign is designed to target BOSS (Bharat Operating System Solutions) Linux systems, with the remote access trojan capable of establishing command-and-control (C2) using WebSockets.
The malware supports four different methods for persistence, including creating a systemd service, setting up a cron job, adding the malware to the Linux autostart directory (&quot;$HOME/.config/autostart&quot;), and configuring .bashrc to launch the trojan by means of a shell script written to the &quot;$HOME/.config/system-backup/&quot; directory.
DeskRAT supports five different commands -
&quot;DeskRAT&#x27;s C2 servers are named as stealth servers,&quot; the French cybersecurity company said. &quot;In this context, a stealth server refers to a name server that does not appear in any publicly visible NS records for the associated domain.&quot;
&quot;While the initial campaigns leveraged legitimate cloud storage platforms such as Google Drive to distribute malicious payloads, TransparentTribe has now transitioned to using dedicated staging servers.&quot;
The findings follow a report from QiAnXin XLab, which detailed the campaign&#x27;s targeting of Windows endpoints with a Golang backdoor it tracks as StealthServer through phishing emails containing booby-trapped Desktop file attachments, suggesting a cross-platform focus.
It&#x27;s worth noting that StealthServer for Windows comes in three variants -
XLab said it also observed two Linux variants of StealthServer, one of which is DeskRAT with support for an extra command called &quot;welcome.&quot; The second Linux version, on the other hand, uses HTTP for C2 communications instead of WebSocket. It features three commands -
It also recursively searches for files matching a set of extensions right from the root directory (&quot;/&quot;) and then transmits them as it encounters them in an encrypted format via a HTTP POST request to &quot;modgovindia[.]space:4000.&quot; This indicates the Linux variant could have been an earlier iteration of DeskRAT, since the latter features a dedicated &quot;start_collection&quot; command to exfiltrate files.
&quot;The group&#x27;s operations are frequent and characterized by a wide variety of tools, numerous variants, and a high delivery cadence,&quot; QiAnXin XLab said.
Attacks from Other South and East Asian Threat Clusters
The development comes amid the discovery of various campaigns orchestrated by South Asia-focused threat actors in recent weeks -
Notably, these intrusions have also focused on exfiltrating WhatsApp communications from compromised hosts using a number of modules – viz., Uplo Exfiltrator and Stom Exfiltrator – that are devoted to capturing various files exchanged through the popular messaging platform.
Another tool used by the threat actor is ChromeStealer Exfiltrator, which, as the name implies, is capable of harvesting cookies, tokens, and other sensitive information from Google Chrome, as well as siphon files related to WhatsApp.
The disclosure paints a picture of a hacking group that has evolved beyond relying on tools from other threat actors into a sophisticated threat operation, wielding its own arsenal of custom malware. The adversary is known to share tactical overlaps with Origami Elephant , Confucius , and SideWinder, all of which are assessed to be operating with Indian interests in mind.
&quot;Mysterious Elephant is a highly sophisticated and active Advanced Persistent Threat group that poses a significant threat to government entities and foreign affairs sectors in the Asia-Pacific region,&quot; Kaspesky said. &quot;The use of custom-made and open-source tools, such as BabShell and MemLoader, highlights their technical expertise and willingness to invest in developing advanced malware.&quot;

Does your organization suffer from a cybersecurity perception gap? Findings from the Bitdefender 2025 Cybersecurity Assessment suggest the answer is probably &quot;yes&quot; — and many leaders may not even realize it.
This disconnect matters. Small differences in perception today can evolve into major blind spots tomorrow. After all, perception influences what organizations prioritize, where they allocate resources, and how they respond in critical moments.
Confidence at the Top, Caution on the Ground
Bitdefender&#x27;s latest assessment surveyed 1,200 cybersecurity and IT professionals , and at first glance, the results suggest optimism. An impressive 93% say they are &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;very confident&quot; in their ability to manage cyber risk as the attack surface expands.
But dig deeper, and the optimism begins to split.
Nearly half ( 45% ) of C-level respondents — including CISOs and CIOs — describe themselves as &quot;very confident&quot; in their organization&#x27;s readiness. Yet among mid-level managers, that number drops sharply to just 19% .
Executives, it seems, are more than twice as likely as operational teams to feel assured about their cybersecurity posture.
When leadership overestimates readiness, it can lead to underinvestment in people, processes, and technology. But perhaps it&#x27;s not about who&#x27;s right — rather, it&#x27;s about how differently each group views the same landscape.
Why the Cybersecurity Perception Gap Exists
In a recent conversation with several Bitdefender cybersecurity experts, we explored what drives this perception gap — and why it persists across so many organizations.
Sean Nikkel , Team Lead at the Bitdefender Cyber Intelligence Fusion Cell , says it&#x27;s no surprise that front-line professionals tend to have lower confidence in their organization&#x27;s cyber resilience. They&#x27;re the ones confronting risks up close.
&quot;Think about what happens after a merger or acquisition,&quot; Nikkel explains. &quot;Whatever risk the acquired company carried, you now inherit. You can go from 100% green to yellow overnight — legacy systems, forgotten shadow IT, outdated processes. Those details are often invisible to leadership but painfully clear to security teams.&quot;
Martin Zugec , Bitdefender Technical Solutions Director, agrees. &quot;In my investigations, I often see a completely different version of cybersecurity than what&#x27;s being discussed online,&quot; he says. &quot;There&#x27;s a gap between perception and reality — and that gap seems to be widening.&quot;
For Nick Jackson , Bitdefender&#x27;s Director of Cybersecurity Services, the issue often comes down to communication . &quot;Mid-level managers handle much of the operational load, while CISOs and C-level leaders focus on strategic planning,&quot; he notes. &quot;Without strong reporting and collaboration, those worlds can drift apart.&quot;
How to Close the Perception Gap
Bridging this divide isn&#x27;t just about improving communication — it&#x27;s a strategic imperative. Jackson, who helps organizations align through the Bitdefender Security Advisory , says the solution starts with mutual understanding.
&quot;When both sides understand each other&#x27;s perspectives — the executive&#x27;s focus on risk appetite and business priorities, and the manager&#x27;s daily reality of operational threats — they can make smarter, faster decisions,&quot; Jackson explains.
Better alignment helps everyone. Mid-level managers gain insight into why the company might accept certain risks or limit spending in specific areas. Meanwhile, executives gain a clearer view of the on-the-ground challenges that create those concerns in the first place.
Ultimately, cybersecurity success depends on shared visibility and trust. Closing the perception gap builds a culture where executives and practitioners move in sync — aligning strategy with reality to strengthen the entire organization.

A malicious network of YouTube accounts has been observed publishing and promoting videos that lead to malware downloads, essentially abusing the popularity and trust associated with the video hosting platform for propagating malicious payloads.
Active since 2021, the network has published more than 3,000 malicious videos to date, with the volume of such videos tripling since the start of the year. It has been codenamed the YouTube Ghost Network by Check Point. Google has since stepped in to remove a majority of these videos.
The campaign leverages hacked accounts and replaces their content with &quot;malicious&quot; videos that are centred around pirated software and Roblox game cheats to infect unsuspecting users searching for them with stealer malware. Some of these videos have racked up hundreds of thousands of views, ranging from 147,000 to 293,000.
&quot;This operation took advantage of trust signals, including views, likes, and comments, to make malicious content seem safe,&quot; Eli Smadja, security research group manager at Check Point, said. &quot;What looks like a helpful tutorial can actually be a polished cyber trap. The scale, modularity, and sophistication of this network make it a blueprint for how threat actors now weaponize engagement tools to spread malware.&quot;
The use of YouTube for malware distribution is not a new phenomenon. For years, threat actors have been observed hijacking legitimate channels or using newly created accounts to publish tutorial-style videos with descriptions pointing to malicious links that, when clicked, lead to malware.
These attacks are part of a broader trend where attackers repurpose legitimate platforms for nefarious purposes, turning them into an effective avenue for malware distribution. While some of the campaigns have abused legitimate ad networks, such as those associated with search engines like Google or Bing, others have capitalized on GitHub as a delivery vehicle, as in the case of the Stargazers Ghost Network .
One of the main reasons why Ghost Networks has taken off in a big way is that they can not only be used to amplify the perceived legitimacy of the links shared, but also maintain operational continuity even when the accounts are banned or taken down by the platform owners, thanks to their role-based structure.
&quot;These accounts take advantage of various platform features, such as videos, descriptions, posts (a lesser-known YouTube feature similar to Facebook post), and comments to promote malicious content and distribute malware, while creating a false sense of trust,&quot; security researcher Antonis Terefos said.
&quot;The majority of the network consists of compromised YouTube accounts, which, once added, are assigned specific operational roles. This role-based structure enables stealthier distribution, as banned accounts can be rapidly replaced without disrupting the overall operation.&quot;
There are three specific types of accounts -
The links direct users to a wide range of services like MediaFire, Dropbox, or Google Drive, or phishing pages hosted on Google Sites, Blogger, and Telegraph that, in turn, incorporate links to download the supposed software. In many of these cases, the links are concealed using URL shorteners to mask the true destination.
Some of the malware families distributed via the YouTube Ghost Network include Lumma Stealer , Rhadamanthys Stealer , StealC Stealer , RedLine Stealer , Phemedrone Stealer , and other Node.js-based loaders and downloaders -
&quot;The ongoing evolution of malware distribution methods demonstrates the remarkable adaptability and resourcefulness of threat actors in bypassing conventional security defenses,&quot; Check Point said. &quot;Adversaries are increasingly shifting toward more sophisticated, platform-based strategies, most notably, the deployment of Ghost Networks.&quot;
&quot;These networks leverage the trust inherent in legitimate accounts and the engagement mechanisms of popular platforms to orchestrate large-scale, persistent, and highly effective malware campaigns.&quot;

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a self-propagating worm that spreads via Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions on the Open VSX Registry and the Microsoft Extension Marketplace, underscoring how developers have become a prime target for attacks.
The sophisticated threat, codenamed GlassWorm by Koi Security, is the second such supply chain attack to hit the DevOps space within a span of a month after the Shai-Hulud worm that targeted the npm ecosystem in mid-September 2025.
What makes the attack stand out is the use of the Solana blockchain for command-and-control (C2), making the infrastructure resilient to takedown efforts. It also uses Google Calendar as a C2 fallback mechanism.
Another novel aspect is that the GlassWorm campaign relies on &quot;invisible Unicode characters that make malicious code literally disappear from code editors,&quot; Idan Dardikman said in a technical report. &quot;The attacker used Unicode variation selectors – special characters that are part of the Unicode specification but don&#x27;t produce any visual output.&quot;
The end goal of the attack is to harvest npm, Open VSX, GitHub, and Git credentials, drain funds from 49 different cryptocurrency wallet extensions, deploy SOCKS proxy servers to turn developer machines into conduits for criminal activities, install hidden VNC (HVNC) servers for remote access, and weaponize the stolen credentials to compromise additional packages and extensions for further propagation.
The names of the infected extensions, 13 of them on Open VSX and one on the Microsoft Extension Marketplace, are listed below. These extensions have been downloaded about 35,800 times. The first wave of infections took place on October 17, 2025. It&#x27;s currently not known how these extensions were hijacked.
The malicious code concealed within the extensions is designed to search for transactions associated with an attacker-controlled wallet on the Solana blockchain, and if found, it proceeds to extract a Base64-encoded string from the memo field that decodes to the C2 server (&quot;217.69.3[.]218&quot; or &quot;199.247.10[.]166&quot;) used for retrieving the next-stage payload.
The payload is an information stealer that captures credentials, authentication tokens, and cryptocurrency wallet data, and reaches out to a Google Calendar event to parse another Base64-encoded string and contact the same server to obtain a payload codenamed Zombi. The data is exfiltrated to a remote endpoint (&quot;140.82.52[.]31:80&quot;) managed by the threat actor.
Written in JavaScript, the Zombi module essentially turns a GlassWorm infection into a full-fledged compromise by dropping a SOCKS proxy, WebRTC modules for peer-to-peer communication, BitTorrent&#x27;s Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for decentralized command distribution, and HVNC for remote control.
The problem is compounded by the fact that VS Code extensions are configured to auto-update, allowing the threat actors to push the malicious code automatically without requiring any user interaction.
&quot;This isn&#x27;t a one-off supply chain attack,&quot; Dardikman said. &quot;It&#x27;s a worm designed to spread through the developer ecosystem like wildfire.&quot;
&quot;Attackers have figured out how to make supply chain malware self-sustaining. They&#x27;re not just compromising individual packages anymore – they&#x27;re building worms that can spread autonomously through the entire software development ecosystem.&quot;
The development comes as the use of blockchain for staging malicious payloads has witnessed a surge due to its pseudonymity and flexibility, with even threat actors from North Korea leveraging the technique to orchestrate their espionage and financially motivated campaigns.

"><div class="cell-inner"><div class="cell-content">Self-Spreading &#x27;GlassWorm&#x27; Infects VS Code Extensions in Widespread Supply Chain Attack
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a self-propagating worm that spreads via Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions on the Open VSX Registry and the Microsoft Extension Marketplace, underscoring how developers have become a prime target for attacks.
The sophisticated threat, codenamed GlassWorm by Koi Security, is the second such supply chain attack to hit the DevOps space within a span of a month after the Shai-Hulud worm that targeted the npm ecosystem in mid-September 2025.
What makes the attack stand out is the use of the Solana blockchain for command-and-control (C2), making the infrastructure resilient to takedown efforts. It also uses Google Calendar as a C2 fallback mechanism.
Another novel aspect is that the GlassWorm campaign relies on &quot;invisible Unicode characters that make malicious code literally disappear from code editors,&quot; Idan Dardikman said in a technical report. &quot;The attacker used Unicode variation selectors – special characters that are part of the Unicode specification but don&#x27;t produce any visual output.&quot;
The end goal of the attack is to harvest npm, Open VSX, GitHub, and Git credentials, drain funds from 49 different cryptocurrency wallet extensions, deploy SOCKS proxy servers to turn developer machines into conduits for criminal activities, install hidden VNC (HVNC) servers for remote access, and weaponize the stolen credentials to compromise additional packages and extensions for further propagation.
The names of the infected extensions, 13 of them on Open VSX and one on the Microsoft Extension Marketplace, are listed below. These extensions have been downloaded about 35,800 times. The first wave of infections took place on October 17, 2025. It&#x27;s currently not known how these extensions were hijacked.
The malicious code concealed within the extensions is designed to search for transactions associated with an attacker-controlled wallet on the Solana blockchain, and if found, it proceeds to extract a Base64-encoded string from the memo field that decodes to the C2 server (&quot;217.69.3[.]218&quot; or &quot;199.247.10[.]166&quot;) used for retrieving the next-stage payload.
The payload is an information stealer that captures credentials, authentication tokens, and cryptocurrency wallet data, and reaches out to a Google Calendar event to parse another Base64-encoded string and contact the same server to obtain a payload codenamed Zombi. The data is exfiltrated to a remote endpoint (&quot;140.82.52[.]31:80&quot;) managed by the threat actor.
Written in JavaScript, the Zombi module essentially turns a GlassWorm infection into a full-fledged compromise by dropping a SOCKS proxy, WebRTC modules for peer-to-peer communication, BitTorrent&#x27;s Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for decentralized command distribution, and HVNC for remote control.
The problem is compounded by the fact that VS Code extensions are configured to auto-update, allowing the threat actors to push the malicious code automatically without requiring any user interaction.
&quot;This isn&#x27;t a one-off supply chain attack,&quot; Dardikman said. &quot;It&#x27;s a worm designed to spread through the developer ecosystem like wildfire.&quot;
&quot;Attackers have figured out how to make supply chain malware self-sustaining. They&#x27;re not just compromising individual packages anymore – they&#x27;re building worms that can spread autonomously through the entire software development ecosystem.&quot;
The development comes as the use of blockchain for staging malicious payloads has witnessed a surge due to its pseudonymity and flexibility, with even threat actors from North Korea leveraging the technique to orchestrate their espionage and financially motivated campaigns.

Threat actors with ties to North Korea have been attributed to a new wave of attacks targeting European companies active in the defense industry as part of a long-running campaign known as Operation Dream Job .
&quot;Some of these [companies] are heavily involved in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sector, suggesting that the operation may be linked to North Korea&#x27;s current efforts to scale up its drone program,&quot; ESET security researchers Peter Kálnai and Alexis Rapin said in a report shared with The Hacker News.
It&#x27;s assessed that the end goal of the campaign is to plunder proprietary information and manufacturing know-how using malware families such as ScoringMathTea and MISTPEN. The Slovak cybersecurity company said it observed the campaign starting in late March 2025.
Some of the targeted entities include a metal engineering company in Southeastern Europe, a manufacturer of aircraft components in Central Europe, and a defense company in Central Europe.
While ScoringMathTea (aka ForestTiger ) was previously observed by ESET in early 2023 in connection with cyber attacks targeting an Indian technology company and a defense contractor in Poland, MISTPEN was documented by Google Mandiant in September 2024 as part of intrusions aimed at companies in the energy and aerospace verticals. The first appearance of ScoringMathTea dates back to October 2022.
Operation Dream Job, first exposed by Israeli cybersecurity company ClearSky in 2020, is a persistent attack campaign mounted by a prolific North Korean hacking group dubbed Lazarus Group, which is also tracked as APT-Q-1, Black Artemis, Diamond Sleet (formerly Zinc), Hidden Cobra, TEMP.Hermit, and UNC2970. The hacking group is believed to be operational since at least 2009.
In these attacks, the threat actors leverage social engineering lures akin to Contagious Interview to approach prospective targets with lucrative job opportunities and trick them into infecting their systems with malware. The campaign also exhibits overlaps with clusters tracked as DeathNote , NukeSped , Operation In(ter)ception, and Operation North Star .
&quot;The dominant theme is a lucrative but faux job offer with a side of malware: the target receives a decoy document with a job description and a trojanized PDF reader to open it,&quot; ESET researchers said.
The attack chain leads to the execution of a binary, which is responsible for sideloading a malicious DLL that drops ScoringMathTea as well as a sophisticated downloader codenamed BinMergeLoader, which functions similarly to MISTPEN and uses Microsoft Graph API and tokens to fetch additional payloads.
Alternate infection sequences have been found to leverage an unknown dropper to deliver two interim payloads, the first of which loads the latter, ultimately resulting in the deployment of ScoringMathTea, an advanced RAT that supports around 40 commands to take complete control over the compromised machines.
&quot;For nearly three years, Lazarus has maintained a consistent modus operandi, deploying its preferred main payload, ScoringMathTea, and using similar methods to trojanize open-source applications,&quot; ESET said. &quot;This predictable, yet effective, strategy delivers sufficient polymorphism to evade security detection, even if it is insufficient to mask the group&#x27;s identity and obscure the attribution process.&quot;

Criminals don’t need to be clever all the time; they just follow the easiest path in: trick users, exploit stale components, or abuse trusted systems like OAuth and package registries. If your stack or habits make any of those easy, you’re already a target.
This week’s ThreatsDay highlights show exactly how those weak points are being exploited — from overlooked misconfigurations to sophisticated new attack chains that turn ordinary tools into powerful entry points.

The activity of the Lumma Stealer (aka Water Kurita) information stealer has witnessed a &quot;sudden drop&quot; since last months after the identities of five alleged core group members were exposed as part of what&#x27;s said to be an aggressive underground exposure campaign dubbed Lumma Rats since late August 2025. The targeted individuals are affiliated with the malware&#x27;s development and administration, with their personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, passwords, and social media profiles leaked on a dedicated website. Since then, Lumma Stealer&#x27;s Telegram accounts were reportedly compromised on September 17, further hampering their ability to communicate with customers and coordinate operations. These actions have led customers to pivot to other stealers like Vidar and StealC. It&#x27;s believed the doxxing campaign is driven by internal rivalries. &quot;The exposure campaign was accompanied by threats, accusations of betrayal within the cybercriminal community, and claims that the Lumma Stealer team had prioritized profit over the operational security of their clients,&quot; Trend Micro said . &quot;The campaign&#x27;s consistency and depth suggest insider knowledge or access to compromised accounts and databases.&quot; While Lumma Stealer faced a setback earlier this year after its infrastructure was taken in a coordinated law enforcement effort, it quickly resurfaced and resumed its operations. Viewed in that light, the latest development could threaten its commercial viability and hurt customer trust. The development coincides with the emergence of Vidar Stealer 2.0, which has been completely rewritten from scratch using C, along with supporting multi-threaded architecture for faster, more efficient data exfiltration and improved evasion capabilities. It also incorporates advanced credential extraction methods to bypass Google Chrome&#x27;s app-bound encryption protections by means of memory injection techniques, and boasts of an automatic polymorphic builder to generate samples with distinct binary signatures, making static detection methods more challenging. &quot;The new version of Vidar employs heavy use of control flow flattening, implementing complex switch-case structures with numeric state machines that can make reverse engineering more difficult,&quot; Trend Micro said .
A large-scale scam operation has misappropriated the images and likenesses of Singapore government officials to deceive Singapore citizens and residents into engaging with a fraudulent investment platform. &quot;The scam campaign relies on paid Google Ads, intermediary redirect websites designed to conceal fraudulent and malicious activity, and highly convincing fake web pages,&quot; Group-IB said . &quot;Victims were ultimately directed to a forex investment platform registered in Mauritius, operating under a seemingly legitimate legal entity with an official investment license. This structure created an illusion of compliance while enabling cross-border fraudulent activity.&quot; On these scam platforms, victims are urged to fill in their personal information, after which they are aggressively pursued via phone calls to deposit substantial sums of money. In all, 28 verified advertiser accounts were used by the scammers to run malicious Google Ads campaigns. The ad distribution was managed primarily through verified advertiser accounts registered to individuals residing in Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Argentina, and Kazakhstan. These ads were configured such that they were only served to people searching or browsing from Singapore IP addresses. To enhance the scam&#x27;s legitimacy, the threat actors created 119 malicious domains that impersonated legitimate and reputable mainstream news outlets like CNA and Yahoo! News.
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious npm package named &quot;https-proxy-utils&quot; that&#x27;s designed to download and execute a payload from an external server (cloudcenter[.]top) containing the AdaptixC2 post-exploitation framework by means of a post-install script. It&#x27;s capable of targeting Windows, Linux, and macOS systems, employing OS-specific techniques to load and launch the implant. Once deployed, the agent can be used to remotely control the machine, execute commands, and achieve persistence. According to data from ReversingLabs, the package was uploaded to npm by a user named &quot;bestdev123&quot; on July 28, 2025. It has 57 recorded downloads. The package is no longer available on the npm registry. While attackers abusing security tools for nefarious purposes is not a new phenomenon, coupling it with rogue packages on open-source repositories exposes users to supply chain risks. &quot;This malicious package emphasizes once more that developers must exercise extreme caution when choosing what to install and depend on, as the supply chain landscape is filled with thousands of packages—often with deceptively similar names—making it far from straightforward to distinguish legitimate components from malicious impostors.&quot; Henrik Plate, cybersecurity expert at Endor Labs, said. &quot;In addition, they should consider disabling post-installation hooks, to prevent malware from being executed upon installation, e.g., by using npm&#x27;s --ignore-scripts option, or by using pnpm, which started to disable the use of lifecycle scripts by default.&quot;
Financial regulators in Canada issued $176 million in fines against Xeltox Enterprises Ltd. (aka Cryptomus and Certa Payments Ltd.), a digital payments platform that supports dozens of Russian cryptocurrency exchanges and websites peddling cybercrime services, according to security journalist Brian Krebs. FINTRAC said the service &quot;failed to submit suspicious transaction reports for transactions where there were reasonable grounds to suspect that they were related to the laundering of proceeds connected to trafficking in child sexual abuse material, fraud, ransomware payments, and sanctions evasion.&quot; The agency said it found 1,068 instances where Cryptomus did not submit reports for July 2024 transactions involving known darknet markets and virtual currency wallets with ties to criminal activity.
SpaceX said it has disabled more than 2,500 Starlink devices connected to scam compounds in Myanmar . It&#x27;s currently not clear when the devices were taken offline. The development comes close on the heels of ongoing actions to crack down on online scam centers, with Myanmar&#x27;s military junta conducting raids on a scam hotspot in a rebel-held region of eastern Myanmar, detaining more than 2,000 people and seizing dozens of Starlink satellite internet devices at KK Park, a sprawling cybercrime hub to the south of Myawaddy. In February 2025, the Thai government cut off power supply to three areas in Myanmar, Myawaddy, Payathonzu, and Tachileik, which have become havens for criminal syndicates who have coerced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams, including false romantic ploys, bogus investment opportunities, and illegal gambling schemes. These operations have been massively successful, ensnaring hundreds of thousands of workers and raking in tens of billions of dollars every year from victims, per estimates from the United Nations. The scam centers emerged out of Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar since the COVID-19 pandemic, but have since spread to other parts of the world such as Africa. Workers at the &quot;labor camps&quot; are often recruited and trafficked under the promise of well-paid jobs and then held captive with threats of violence. In recent months, law enforcement authorities have stepped up their efforts , arresting hundreds of suspects across Asia and deporting several of them. According to the Global New Light of Myanmar , a total of 9,551 foreign nationals who illegally entered Myanmar have been arrested between January 30 and October 19, 2025, with 9,337 deported to their respective countries. Earlier this week, South Korean police officials formally arrested 50 South Koreans repatriated from Cambodia on accusations they worked for online scam organizations in the Southeast Asian country. Cambodia and South Korea recently agreed to partner in combating online scams following the death of a South Korean student who was reportedly forced to work in a scam center in Cambodia. The death of the 22-year-old has also prompted South Korea, which is reportedly readying sanctions against the groups operating in Cambodia, to issue a &quot;code black&quot; travel ban to parts of the country, citing recent increases in cases of detention and &quot;fraudulent employment.&quot; More than 1,000 South Koreans are believed to be among around 200,000 people of various nationalities working in Cambodia&#x27;s scam industry.
A security flaw in the Oat++ implementation of Anthropic&#x27;s Model Context Protocol (MCP) could allow attackers to predict or capture session IDs from active AI conversations, hijack MCP sessions, and inject malicious responses via the oatpp-mcp server. The vulnerability, dubbed Prompt Hijacking, is being tracked as CVE-2025-6515 (CVSS score: 6.8). While the generated session ID used with Server-Sent Events ( SSE ) transports is designed to route responses from the MCP server to the client and distinguish between different MCP client sessions, the attack takes advantage of the fact that SSE does not require session IDs to be unique and cryptographically secure (a requirement enforced in the newer Streamable HTTP specification) to allow a threat actor in possession of a valid session ID to send malicious requests to the MCP server, allowing them to hijack the responses and relay a poisoned response back to the client. &quot;Once a session ID is reused, the attacker can send POST requests using the hijacked ID, for example – Requesting tools, triggering prompts, or injecting commands, and the server will forward the relevant responses to the victim&#x27;s active GET connection in addition to the responses generated for the victim&#x27;s original requests,&quot; JFrog said .
Proofpoint has developed an automated toolkit named Fassa (short for &quot;Future Account Super Secret Access&quot;), which demonstrates methods by which threat actors establish persistent access through malicious OAuth applications. The tool has not been made publicly available. &quot;The strategic value of this approach lies in its persistence mechanism: even if the compromised user&#x27;s credentials are reset or multifactor authentication is enforced, the malicious OAuth applications maintain their authorized access,&quot; the enterprise security company said. &quot;This creates a resilient backdoor that can remain undetected within the environment indefinitely, unless specifically identified and remediated.&quot; In one real-world attack observed by Proofpoint, threat actors have been found to take control of Microsoft accounts using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing kit known as Tycoon, and then created malicious mailbox rules and registered a second-party (aka internal) OAuth application named &quot;test&quot; to enable persistent access to the victim&#x27;s mailbox even after the password is reset.
Cybersecurity researchers Gal Nagli, Ian Carroll, and Sam Curry have disclosed a severe vulnerability in a critical Driver Categorisation portal (&quot;driverscategorisation.fia[.]com&quot;) managed by the International Automobile Federation (FIA) that could make it possible to access the sensitive data associated with every Formula 1 (F1) driver, including passport, driver&#x27;s license, and personal information. While the portal allows any individual to open an account, along with providing supporting documents, the researchers found that sending a specially crafted request where they assume the role of an &quot;ADMIN&quot; is enough to trick the system into actually assigning administrative privileges to a newly created account, using which an attacker could access detailed driver profiles. Following responsible disclosure on June 3, 2025, a comprehensive fix for the bug was rolled out on June 10. &quot;[The vulnerability is] called &#x27;Mass Assignment&#x27; – a classic web / api security flaw,&quot; Nagli said . &quot;In simple terms: The server trusted whatever we sent it, without checking if we were ALLOWED to change those fields.&quot;
Google has launched a comprehensive agentic platform with the goal of accelerating threat analysis and response. The platform, available in preview for Google Threat Intelligence Enterprise and Enterprise+ customers, provides users with a set of specialized agents for cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and malware analysis. &quot;When you ask a question, the platform intelligently selects the best agent and tools to craft your answer, scouring everything from the open web and OSINT to the deep and dark web and our own curated threat reports,&quot; Google said . In the event the query is about a malicious file, it routes the task to its malware analyst agent to provide the &quot;most precise and relevant information.&quot; The tech giant said the platform is designed to uncover hidden connections that exist between threat actors, vulnerabilities, malware families, and campaigns by tapping into Google Threat Intelligence&#x27;s comprehensive security dataset.
A new phishing kit named Tykit is being used to serve fake Microsoft 365 login pages to which users are redirected to via email messages containing SVG files as attachments. Once opened, the SVG file executes a &quot;trampoline&quot; JavaScript code to take the victim to the phishing page, but not before completing a Cloudflare Turnstile security check. &quot;It&#x27;s worth noting that the client-side code includes basic anti-debugging measures, for example, it blocks key combinations that open DevTools and disables the context menu,&quot; ANY.RUN said . Once the credentials are entered, the user is redirected to the legitimate page to avoid raising any suspicion.
GitGuardian said it has uncovered a path traversal vulnerability in Smithery.ai that provided unauthorized access to thousands of MCP servers and their associated credentials, leading to a major supply chain risk. The problem has to do with the fact that the smithery.yaml configuration file used to build a server in Docker contains an improperly controlled property called dockerBuildPath, which allows any arbitrary path to be specified. &quot;A simple configuration bug allowed attackers to access sensitive files on the registry&#x27;s infrastructure, leading to the theft of overprivileged administrative credentials,&quot; GitGuardian said . &quot;These stolen credentials provided access to over 3,000 hosted AI servers, enabling the theft of API keys and secrets from potentially thousands of customers across hundreds of services.&quot; The issue has since been addressed, and there is no evidence it was exploited in the wild.
Researchers have found that it&#x27;s possible to bypass the human approval step required when running sensitive system commands using modern artificial intelligence (AI) agents. According to Trail of Bits, this bypass can be achieved through argument injection attacks that exploit pre-approved commands, allowing an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE). To counter these risks, it&#x27;s recommended to sandbox agent operations from the host system, reduce safe command allowlists, and use safe command execution methods that prevent shell interpretation.
A security vulnerability in the python-socketio library ( CVE-2025-61765 , CVSS score: 6.4) could permit attackers to execute arbitrary Python code through malicious pickle deserialization in scenarios where they have already gained access to the message queue that the servers use for internal communications. &quot;The pickle module is designed for serializing and deserializing trusted Python objects,&quot; BlueRock said . &quot;It was never intended to be a secure format for communicating between systems that don&#x27;t implicitly trust each other. Yet, the python-socketio client managers indiscriminately unpickle every message received from the shared message broker.&quot; As a result, a threat actor with access to the message queue can send a specially crafted pickle payload that gets executed once it&#x27;s deserialized. The issue has been addressed in version 5.14.0 of the library.
AI-powered coding tools like Cursor and Windsurf have been found vulnerable to more than 94 known and patched security issues in the Chromium browser and the V8 JavaScript engine, putting over 1.8 million developers at risk, according to OX Security. The problem is that both the development environments are built on old versions of Visual Studio Code that are bundled with an Electron application runtime that points to outdated versions of the open-source Chromium browser and Google&#x27;s V8 engine. &quot;This is a classic supply chain attack waiting to happen,&quot; the cybersecurity company said . &quot;Cursor and Windsurf must prioritize upstream security updates. Until they do, 1.8 million developers remain exposed to attacks that could compromise not just their machines, but the entire software supply chain they&#x27;re part of.&quot;
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new attack chain that leverages bogus installers for Google Chrome as a lure to drop a remote access trojan called ValleyRAT as part of a multi-stage process. The binary is designed to drop an intermediate payload that scans for antivirus products primarily used in China and uses a kernel driver to terminate the associated processes so as to evade detection. ValleyRAT is launched by means of a DLL downloader that retrieves the malware from an external server (&quot;202.95.11[.]152&quot;). Also called Winos 4.0, the malware is linked to a Chinese cybercrime group known as Silver Fox. &quot;Our analysis revealed Chinese language strings within the binary, including the internal DLL name, and identified that the targeted security solutions are products from Chinese vendors,&quot; Cyderes researcher Rahul Ramesh said . &quot;This indicates the attackers have knowledge of the regional software environment and suggests the campaign is tailored to target victims in China.&quot; It&#x27;s worth noting that similar fake installers for Chrome have been used to distribute Gh0st RAT in the past.
Varonis has disclosed details of a loophole that allows attackers to impersonate Microsoft applications by creating malicious apps with deceptive names such as &quot;Azure Portal&quot; or &quot;Azure SQL Database&quot; with hidden Unicode characters, effectively bypassing safeguards put in place to prevent the use of reserved names . This includes inserting &quot;0x34f&quot; between the application name such as &quot;Az$([char]0x34f)ur$([char]0x34f)e Po$([char]0x34f)rtal.&quot; This technique, codenamed Azure App-Mirage by Varonis, could then be combined with approaches like device code phishing to trick users into sharing authentication codes and gain unauthorized access to their accounts. Microsoft has since rolled out fixes to plug the issue.
Threat actors have been observed exploiting weaknesses in internet-facing database servers and abusing legitimate commands to steal, encrypt, or destroy data and demand payment in exchange for returning the files or keeping them private. This is part of an ongoing trend where attackers are increasingly going malware-less, instead resorting to living-off-the-land techniques to blend in with normal activity and achieve their goals. &quot;Attackers connect remotely to these servers, copy the data to another location, wipe the database, and then leave behind a ransom note stored in the database itself,&quot; cloud security firm Wiz said . &quot;This approach bypasses many conventional detection methods because no malicious binary is ever dropped; the damage is done entirely with normal database commands.&quot; Some of the most targeted database servers in ransomware attacks include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Amazon Aurora MySQL, and MariaDB.
Attackers are increasingly employing Cascading Style Sheets&#x27; (CSS) text, visibility and display properties, and sizing properties to insert hidden text (paragraphs and comments) and characters into emails in what&#x27;s seen as a way to slip past spam filters and enterprise security defenses. &quot;There is widespread use of hidden text salting in malicious emails to bypass detection,&quot; Cisco Talos researcher Omid Mirzaei said . &quot;Attackers embed hidden salt in the preheader, header, attachments, and body — using characters, paragraphs, and comments — by manipulating text, visibility, and sizing properties.&quot; The cybersecurity company also noted that hidden content is more commonly found in spam and other email threats than in legitimate emails. This creates a challenge for security solutions that rely on a large language model (LLM) to classify incoming messages, as a threat actor can conceal hidden prompts to influence the outcome.
A phone-tracking and surveillance platform named Altamides from a little-known European-led company in Indonesia called First Wap has been used to secretly track the movements of more than 14,000 phone numbers. It&#x27;s run by European founders. According to an investigation published by Mother Jones, the platform was used to track political figures, famous executives, journalists, and activists. It exploited vulnerabilities in the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) telecommunications protocol to zero in on an individual&#x27;s location using only their phone number. The development comes a little over a month after Amnesty International revealed that Pakistan is spying on millions of its citizens using a phone-tapping system and a Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media. &quot;Pakistan’s Web Monitoring System [WMS] and Lawful Intercept Management System [LIMS] operate like watchtowers, constantly snooping on the lives of ordinary citizens,&quot; Agnès Callamard, Secretary General at Amnesty International, said . &quot;In Pakistan, your texts, emails, calls, and internet access are all under scrutiny. But people have no idea of this constant surveillance, and its incredible reach. This dystopian reality is extremely dangerous because it operates in the shadows, severely restricting freedom of expression and access to information.&quot; It has been found that a German company, Utimaco, and an Emirati company, Datafusion, supplied most of the technology that enables LIMS to operate in Pakistan. While the first iteration of WMS was installed in 2018 using technology provided by Sandvine, it has since been replaced by advanced technology from China&#x27;s Geedge Networks in 2023. This is assessed to be a commercialized version of China&#x27;s Great Firewall. These findings also dovetail with a report from the Associated Press, which found U.S. tech companies designed and marketed systems that became the foundation for China&#x27;s surveillance state. &quot;While the flood of American technology slowed considerably starting in 2019 after outrage and sanctions over atrocities in Xinjiang, it laid the foundation for China&#x27;s surveillance apparatus that Chinese companies have since built on and in some cases replaced,&quot; the report said .

Every one of these incidents tells the same story: attackers don’t break in — they log in, inject, or hijack what’s already trusted. The difference between surviving and becoming a headline is how fast you patch, isolate, and verify.
Stay sharp, review your defenses, and keep watching ThreatsDay — because next week’s breaches are already being written in today’s overlooked bugs.

Workers at the &quot;labor camps&quot; are often recruited and trafficked under the promise of well-paid jobs and then held captive with threats of violence. In recent months, law enforcement authorities have stepped up their efforts , arresting hundreds of suspects across Asia and deporting several of them. According to the Global New Light of Myanmar , a total of 9,551 foreign nationals who illegally entered Myanmar have been arrested between January 30 and October 19, 2025, with 9,337 deported to their respective countries. Earlier this week, South Korean police officials formally arrested 50 South Koreans repatriated from Cambodia on accusations they worked for online scam organizations in the Southeast Asian country. Cambodia and South Korea recently agreed to partner in combating online scams following the death of a South Korean student who was reportedly forced to work in a scam center in Cambodia. The death of the 22-year-old has also prompted South Korea, which is reportedly readying sanctions against the groups operating in Cambodia, to issue a &quot;code black&quot; travel ban to parts of the country, citing recent increases in cases of detention and &quot;fraudulent employment.&quot; More than 1,000 South Koreans are believed to be among around 200,000 people of various nationalities working in Cambodia&#x27;s scam industry.
A security flaw in the Oat++ implementation of Anthropic&#x27;s Model Context Protocol (MCP) could allow attackers to predict or capture session IDs from active AI conversations, hijack MCP sessions, and inject malicious responses via the oatpp-mcp server. The vulnerability, dubbed Prompt Hijacking, is being tracked as CVE-2025-6515 (CVSS score: 6.8). While the generated session ID used with Server-Sent Events ( SSE ) transports is designed to route responses from the MCP server to the client and distinguish between different MCP client sessions, the attack takes advantage of the fact that SSE does not require session IDs to be unique and cryptographically secure (a requirement enforced in the newer Streamable HTTP specification) to allow a threat actor in possession of a valid session ID to send malicious requests to the MCP server, allowing them to hijack the responses and relay a poisoned response back to the client. &quot;Once a session ID is reused, the attacker can send POST requests using the hijacked ID, for example – Requesting tools, triggering prompts, or injecting commands, and the server will forward the relevant responses to the victim&#x27;s active GET connection in addition to the responses generated for the victim&#x27;s original requests,&quot; JFrog said .
Proofpoint has developed an automated toolkit named Fassa (short for &quot;Future Account Super Secret Access&quot;), which demonstrates methods by which threat actors establish persistent access through malicious OAuth applications. The tool has not been made publicly available. &quot;The strategic value of this approach lies in its persistence mechanism: even if the compromised user&#x27;s credentials are reset or multifactor authentication is enforced, the malicious OAuth applications maintain their authorized access,&quot; the enterprise security company said. &quot;This creates a resilient backdoor that can remain undetected within the environment indefinitely, unless specifically identified and remediated.&quot; In one real-world attack observed by Proofpoint, threat actors have been found to take control of Microsoft accounts using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing kit known as Tycoon, and then created malicious mailbox rules and registered a second-party (aka internal) OAuth application named &quot;test&quot; to enable persistent access to the victim&#x27;s mailbox even after the password is reset.
Cybersecurity researchers Gal Nagli, Ian Carroll, and Sam Curry have disclosed a severe vulnerability in a critical Driver Categorisation portal (&quot;driverscategorisation.fia[.]com&quot;) managed by the International Automobile Federation (FIA) that could make it possible to access the sensitive data associated with every Formula 1 (F1) driver, including passport, driver&#x27;s license, and personal information. While the portal allows any individual to open an account, along with providing supporting documents, the researchers found that sending a specially crafted request where they assume the role of an &quot;ADMIN&quot; is enough to trick the system into actually assigning administrative privileges to a newly created account, using which an attacker could access detailed driver profiles. Following responsible disclosure on June 3, 2025, a comprehensive fix for the bug was rolled out on June 10. &quot;[The vulnerability is] called &#x27;Mass Assignment&#x27; – a classic web / api security flaw,&quot; Nagli said . &quot;In simple terms: The server trusted whatever we sent it, without checking if we were ALLOWED to change those fields.&quot;
Google has launched a comprehensive agentic platform with the goal of accelerating threat analysis and response. The platform, available in preview for Google Threat Intelligence Enterprise and Enterprise+ customers, provides users with a set of specialized agents for cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and malware analysis. &quot;When you ask a question, the platform intelligently selects the best agent and tools to craft your answer, scouring everything from the open web and OSINT to the deep and dark web and our own curated threat reports,&quot; Google said . In the event the query is about a malicious file, it routes the task to its malware analyst agent to provide the &quot;most precise and relevant information.&quot; The tech giant said the platform is designed to uncover hidden connections that exist between threat actors, vulnerabilities, malware families, and campaigns by tapping into Google Threat Intelligence&#x27;s comprehensive security dataset.
A new phishing kit named Tykit is being used to serve fake Microsoft 365 login pages to which users are redirected to via email messages containing SVG files as attachments. Once opened, the SVG file executes a &quot;trampoline&quot; JavaScript code to take the victim to the phishing page, but not before completing a Cloudflare Turnstile security check. &quot;It&#x27;s worth noting that the client-side code includes basic anti-debugging measures, for example, it blocks key combinations that open DevTools and disables the context menu,&quot; ANY.RUN said . Once the credentials are entered, the user is redirected to the legitimate page to avoid raising any suspicion.
GitGuardian said it has uncovered a path traversal vulnerability in Smithery.ai that provided unauthorized access to thousands of MCP servers and their associated credentials, leading to a major supply chain risk. The problem has to do with the fact that the smithery.yaml configuration file used to build a server in Docker contains an improperly controlled property called dockerBuildPath, which allows any arbitrary path to be specified. &quot;A simple configuration bug allowed attackers to access sensitive files on the registry&#x27;s infrastructure, leading to the theft of overprivileged administrative credentials,&quot; GitGuardian said . &quot;These stolen credentials provided access to over 3,000 hosted AI servers, enabling the theft of API keys and secrets from potentially thousands of customers across hundreds of services.&quot; The issue has since been addressed, and there is no evidence it was exploited in the wild.
Researchers have found that it&#x27;s possible to bypass the human approval step required when running sensitive system commands using modern artificial intelligence (AI) agents. According to Trail of Bits, this bypass can be achieved through argument injection attacks that exploit pre-approved commands, allowing an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE). To counter these risks, it&#x27;s recommended to sandbox agent operations from the host system, reduce safe command allowlists, and use safe command execution methods that prevent shell interpretation.
A security vulnerability in the python-socketio library ( CVE-2025-61765 , CVSS score: 6.4) could permit attackers to execute arbitrary Python code through malicious pickle deserialization in scenarios where they have already gained access to the message queue that the servers use for internal communications. &quot;The pickle module is designed for serializing and deserializing trusted Python objects,&quot; BlueRock said . &quot;It was never intended to be a secure format for communicating between systems that don&#x27;t implicitly trust each other. Yet, the python-socketio client managers indiscriminately unpickle every message received from the shared message broker.&quot; As a result, a threat actor with access to the message queue can send a specially crafted pickle payload that gets executed once it&#x27;s deserialized. The issue has been addressed in version 5.14.0 of the library.
AI-powered coding tools like Cursor and Windsurf have been found vulnerable to more than 94 known and patched security issues in the Chromium browser and the V8 JavaScript engine, putting over 1.8 million developers at risk, according to OX Security. The problem is that both the development environments are built on old versions of Visual Studio Code that are bundled with an Electron application runtime that points to outdated versions of the open-source Chromium browser and Google&#x27;s V8 engine. &quot;This is a classic supply chain attack waiting to happen,&quot; the cybersecurity company said . &quot;Cursor and Windsurf must prioritize upstream security updates. Until they do, 1.8 million developers remain exposed to attacks that could compromise not just their machines, but the entire software supply chain they&#x27;re part of.&quot;
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new attack chain that leverages bogus installers for Google Chrome as a lure to drop a remote access trojan called ValleyRAT as part of a multi-stage process. The binary is designed to drop an intermediate payload that scans for antivirus products primarily used in China and uses a kernel driver to terminate the associated processes so as to evade detection. ValleyRAT is launched by means of a DLL downloader that retrieves the malware from an external server (&quot;202.95.11[.]152&quot;). Also called Winos 4.0, the malware is linked to a Chinese cybercrime group known as Silver Fox. &quot;Our analysis revealed Chinese language strings within the binary, including the internal DLL name, and identified that the targeted security solutions are products from Chinese vendors,&quot; Cyderes researcher Rahul Ramesh said . &quot;This indicates the attackers have knowledge of the regional software environment and suggests the campaign is tailored to target victims in China.&quot; It&#x27;s worth noting that similar fake installers for Chrome have been used to distribute Gh0st RAT in the past.
Varonis has disclosed details of a loophole that allows attackers to impersonate Microsoft applications by creating malicious apps with deceptive names such as &quot;Azure Portal&quot; or &quot;Azure SQL Database&quot; with hidden Unicode characters, effectively bypassing safeguards put in place to prevent the use of reserved names . This includes inserting &quot;0x34f&quot; between the application name such as &quot;Az$([char]0x34f)ur$([char]0x34f)e Po$([char]0x34f)rtal.&quot; This technique, codenamed Azure App-Mirage by Varonis, could then be combined with approaches like device code phishing to trick users into sharing authentication codes and gain unauthorized access to their accounts. Microsoft has since rolled out fixes to plug the issue.
Threat actors have been observed exploiting weaknesses in internet-facing database servers and abusing legitimate commands to steal, encrypt, or destroy data and demand payment in exchange for returning the files or keeping them private. This is part of an ongoing trend where attackers are increasingly going malware-less, instead resorting to living-off-the-land techniques to blend in with normal activity and achieve their goals. &quot;Attackers connect remotely to these servers, copy the data to another location, wipe the database, and then leave behind a ransom note stored in the database itself,&quot; cloud security firm Wiz said . &quot;This approach bypasses many conventional detection methods because no malicious binary is ever dropped; the damage is done entirely with normal database commands.&quot; Some of the most targeted database servers in ransomware attacks include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Amazon Aurora MySQL, and MariaDB.
Attackers are increasingly employing Cascading Style Sheets&#x27; (CSS) text, visibility and display properties, and sizing properties to insert hidden text (paragraphs and comments) and characters into emails in what&#x27;s seen as a way to slip past spam filters and enterprise security defenses. &quot;There is widespread use of hidden text salting in malicious emails to bypass detection,&quot; Cisco Talos researcher Omid Mirzaei said . &quot;Attackers embed hidden salt in the preheader, header, attachments, and body — using characters, paragraphs, and comments — by manipulating text, visibility, and sizing properties.&quot; The cybersecurity company also noted that hidden content is more commonly found in spam and other email threats than in legitimate emails. This creates a challenge for security solutions that rely on a large language model (LLM) to classify incoming messages, as a threat actor can conceal hidden prompts to influence the outcome.
A phone-tracking and surveillance platform named Altamides from a little-known European-led company in Indonesia called First Wap has been used to secretly track the movements of more than 14,000 phone numbers. It&#x27;s run by European founders. According to an investigation published by Mother Jones, the platform was used to track political figures, famous executives, journalists, and activists. It exploited vulnerabilities in the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) telecommunications protocol to zero in on an individual&#x27;s location using only their phone number. The development comes a little over a month after Amnesty International revealed that Pakistan is spying on millions of its citizens using a phone-tapping system and a Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media. &quot;Pakistan’s Web Monitoring System [WMS] and Lawful Intercept Management System [LIMS] operate like watchtowers, constantly snooping on the lives of ordinary citizens,&quot; Agnès Callamard, Secretary General at Amnesty International, said . &quot;In Pakistan, your texts, emails, calls, and internet access are all under scrutiny. But people have no idea of this constant surveillance, and its incredible reach. This dystopian reality is extremely dangerous because it operates in the shadows, severely restricting freedom of expression and access to information.&quot; It has been found that a German company, Utimaco, and an Emirati company, Datafusion, supplied most of the technology that enables LIMS to operate in Pakistan. While the first iteration of WMS was installed in 2018 using technology provided by Sandvine, it has since been replaced by advanced technology from China&#x27;s Geedge Networks in 2023. This is assessed to be a commercialized version of China&#x27;s Great Firewall. These findings also dovetail with a report from the Associated Press, which found U.S. tech companies designed and marketed systems that became the foundation for China&#x27;s surveillance state. &quot;While the flood of American technology slowed considerably starting in 2019 after outrage and sanctions over atrocities in Xinjiang, it laid the foundation for China&#x27;s surveillance apparatus that Chinese companies have since built on and in some cases replaced,&quot; the report said .

Every one of these incidents tells the same story: attackers don’t break in — they log in, inject, or hijack what’s already trusted. The difference between surviving and becoming a headline is how fast you patch, isolate, and verify.
Stay sharp, review your defenses, and keep watching ThreatsDay — because next week’s breaches are already being written in today’s overlooked bugs.

As machine identities explode across cloud environments, enterprises report dramatic productivity gains from eliminating static credentials. And only legacy systems remain the weak link.
For decades, organizations have relied on static secrets, such as API keys, passwords, and tokens, as unique identifiers for workloads. While this approach provides clear traceability, it creates what security researchers describe as an &quot;operational nightmare&quot; of manual lifecycle management, rotation schedules, and constant credential leakage risks.
This challenge has traditionally driven organizations toward centralized secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault or CyberArk, which provide universal brokers for secrets across platforms. However, these approaches perpetuate the fundamental problem: the proliferation of static secrets requiring careful management and rotation.
&quot;Having a workload in Azure that needs to read data from AWS S3 is not ideal from a security perspective,&quot; explains one DevOps engineer managing a multicloud environment. &quot;Cross-cloud authentication and authorization complexity make it hard to set this up securely, especially if we choose to simply configure the Azure workload with AWS access keys.&quot;
The Business Case for Change
Enterprise case studies document that organizations implementing managed identities report a 95% reduction in time spent managing credentials per application component, along with a 75% reduction in time spent learning platform-specific authentication mechanisms, resulting in hundreds of saved hours annually.
But how to approach the transition, and what prevents us from entirely eliminating static secrets?
Platform-Native Solutions
Managed identities represent a paradigm shift from the traditional &quot;what you have&quot; model to a &quot;who you are&quot; approach. Rather than embedding static credentials into applications, modern platforms now provide identity services that issue short-lived, automatically rotated credentials to authenticated workloads.
The transformation spans major cloud providers:
The Hybrid Reality
However, the reality is more nuanced. Security experts emphasize that managed identities don&#x27;t solve every authentication challenge. Third-party APIs still require API keys, legacy systems often can&#x27;t integrate with modern identity providers, and cross-organizational authentication may still require shared secrets.
&quot;Using a secret manager dramatically improves the security posture of systems that rely on shared secrets, but heavy use perpetuates the use of shared secrets rather than using strong identities,&quot; according to identity security researchers. The goal isn&#x27;t to eliminate secret managers entirely, but to dramatically reduce their scope.
Smart organizations are strategically reducing their secret footprint by 70-80% through managed identities, then using robust secret management for remaining use cases, creating resilient architectures that leverage the best of both worlds.
The Non-Human Identity Discovery Challenge
Most organizations don&#x27;t have visibility into their current credential landscape. IT teams often discover hundreds or thousands of API keys, passwords, and access tokens scattered across their infrastructure, with unclear ownership and usage patterns.
&quot;You can&#x27;t replace what you can&#x27;t see,&quot; explains Gaetan Ferry, a security researcher at GitGuardian. &quot;Before implementing modern identity systems, organizations need to understand exactly what credentials exist and how they&#x27;re being used.&quot;
GitGuardian&#x27;s NHI (Non-Human Identity) Security platform addresses this discovery challenge by providing comprehensive visibility into existing secret landscapes before managed identity implementation.

Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a cybercriminal group called Jingle Thief that has been observed targeting cloud environments associated with organizations in the retail and consumer services sectors for gift card fraud.
&quot;Jingle Thief attackers use phishing and smishing to steal credentials, to compromise organizations that issue gift cards,&quot; Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers Stav Setty and Shachar Roitman said in a Wednesday analysis. &quot;Once they gain access to an organization, they pursue the type and level of access needed to issue unauthorized gift cards.&quot;
The end goal of these efforts is to leverage the issued gift cards for monetary gain by likely reselling them on gray markets. Gift cards make for a lucrative choice as they can be easily redeemed with minimal personal information and are difficult to trace, making it harder for defenders to investigate the fraud.
The name Jingle Thief is a nod to the threat actor&#x27;s pattern of conducting gift card fraud coinciding with festive seasons and holiday periods. The cybersecurity company is tracking the activity under the moniker CL‑CRI‑1032, where &quot;CL&quot; stands for cluster and &quot;CRI&quot; refers to criminal motivation.
The threat cluster has been attributed with moderate confidence to criminal groups tracked as Atlas Lion and Storm-0539 , with Microsoft describing it as a financially motivated crew originating from Morocco. It&#x27;s believed to be active since at least late 2021.
Jingle Thief&#x27;s ability to maintain footholds within compromised organizations for extended periods, in some cases for over a year, makes it a dangerous group. During the time it spends with the environments, the threat actor conducts extensive reconnaissance to map the cloud environment, moves laterally across the cloud, and takes steps to sidestep detection.
Unit 42 said it observed the hacking group launching a wave of coordinated attacks targeting various global enterprises in April and May 2025, using phishing attacks to obtain credentials necessary to breach victims&#x27; cloud infrastructure. In one campaign, the attackers are said to have maintained access for about 10 months and broken into 60 user accounts within a single organization.
&quot;They exploit cloud-based infrastructure to impersonate legitimate users, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and carry out gift card fraud at scale,&quot; the researchers noted.
The attacks often involve attempts to access gift‑card issuance applications to issue high‑value cards across different programs, while simultaneously ensuring these actions leave minimal logs and forensic trails.
They are also highly targeted and tailored to each victim, with the threat actors carrying out reconnaissance before sending persuasive phishing login pages via email or SMS that can fool victims and trick them into entering their Microsoft 365 credentials.
As soon as the credentials are harvested, the attackers waste no time logging into the environment and carry out a second round of reconnaissance, this time targeting the victim&#x27;s SharePoint and OneDrive for information related to business operations, financial processes, and IT workflows.
This includes searching for gift card issuance workflows, VPN configurations and access guides, spreadsheets or internal systems used to issue or track gift cards, and other key details related to virtual machines and Citrix environments.
In the next phase, the threat actors have been found to leverage the compromised account to send phishing emails internally within the organization to broaden their foothold. These messages often mimic IT service notifications or ticketing updates by making use of information gleaned from internal documentation or previous communications.
Furthermore, Jingle Thief is known to create inbox rules to automatically forward emails from hacked accounts to addresses under their control, and then cover up traces of the activity by moving the sent emails immediately to Deleted Items.
In some cases, the threat actor has also been observed registering rogue authenticator apps to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections and even enrolling their devices in Entra ID so as to maintain access even after victims&#x27; passwords are reset or the session tokens are revoked.
Besides their exclusive focus on cloud services rather than endpoint compromise, another aspect that makes Jingle Thief&#x27;s campaigns noteworthy is their propensity for identity misuse over deploying custom malware, thereby minimizing the chances of detection.
&quot;Gift card fraud combines stealth, speed and scalability, especially when paired with access to cloud environments where issuance workflows reside,&quot; Unit 42 said. &quot;This discreet approach helps evade detection while laying the groundwork for future fraud.&quot;
&quot;To exploit these systems, the threat actors need access to internal documentation and communications. They can secure this by stealing credentials and maintaining a quiet, persistent presence within Microsoft 365 environments of targeted organizations that provide gift card services.&quot;

"><div class="cell-inner"><div class="cell-content">&#x27;Jingle Thief&#x27; Hackers Exploit Cloud Infrastructure to Steal Millions in Gift Cards
Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a cybercriminal group called Jingle Thief that has been observed targeting cloud environments associated with organizations in the retail and consumer services sectors for gift card fraud.
&quot;Jingle Thief attackers use phishing and smishing to steal credentials, to compromise organizations that issue gift cards,&quot; Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers Stav Setty and Shachar Roitman said in a Wednesday analysis. &quot;Once they gain access to an organization, they pursue the type and level of access needed to issue unauthorized gift cards.&quot;
The end goal of these efforts is to leverage the issued gift cards for monetary gain by likely reselling them on gray markets. Gift cards make for a lucrative choice as they can be easily redeemed with minimal personal information and are difficult to trace, making it harder for defenders to investigate the fraud.
The name Jingle Thief is a nod to the threat actor&#x27;s pattern of conducting gift card fraud coinciding with festive seasons and holiday periods. The cybersecurity company is tracking the activity under the moniker CL‑CRI‑1032, where &quot;CL&quot; stands for cluster and &quot;CRI&quot; refers to criminal motivation.

E-commerce security company Sansec has warned that threat actors have begun to exploit a recently disclosed security vulnerability in Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source platforms, with more than 250 attack attempts recorded against multiple stores over the past 24 hours.
The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-54236 (CVSS score: 9.1), a critical improper input validation flaw that could be abused to take over customer accounts in Adobe Commerce through the Commerce REST API.
Also known as SessionReaper, it was addressed by Adobe last month. A security researcher who goes by the name Blaklis is credited with the discovery and responsible disclosure of CVE-2025-54236.
The Dutch company said that 62% of Magento stores remain vulnerable to the security flaw six weeks after public disclosure, urging website administrators to apply the patches as soon as possible before broader exploitation activity picks up. Adobe has since revised its advisory to confirm reports of in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2025-54236.
The attacks have originated from the following IP addresses, with unknown threat actors leveraging the flaw to drop PHP webshells or probe phpinfo to extract PHP configuration information.
&quot;PHP backdoors are uploaded via &#x27;/customer/address_file/upload&#x27; as a fake session,&quot; Sansec said .
The development comes as Searchlight Cyber published a detailed technical analysis of CVE-2025-54236, describing it as a nested deserialization flaw that enables remote code execution.
It&#x27;s worth noting that CVE-2025-54236 is the second deserialization vulnerability impacting Adobe Commerce and Magento platforms in as many years. In July 2024, another critical flaw dubbed CosmicSting ( CVE-2024-34102 , CVSS score: 9.8) was subjected to widespread exploitation.
With proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits and additional specifics now entering public domains, it&#x27;s imperative that users move quickly to apply the fixes.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Wednesday added a critical security flaw impacting Motex Lanscope Endpoint Manager to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, stating it has been actively exploited in the wild.
The vulnerability, CVE-2025-61932 (CVSS v4 score: 9.3), impacts on-premises versions of Lanscope Endpoint Manager, specifically Client program and Detection Agent, and could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on susceptible systems.
&quot;Motex LANSCOPE Endpoint Manager contains an improper verification of source of a communication channel vulnerability, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted packets,&quot; CISA said.
The flaw impacts versions 9.4.7.1 and earlier. It has been addressed in the versions below -
It&#x27;s currently not known how the vulnerability is being exploited in real-world attacks, who is behind them, or the scale of such efforts. However, an alert issued by the Japan Vulnerability Notes (JVN) portal earlier this week noted that Motex has confirmed an unnamed customer &quot;received a malicious packet suspected to target this vulnerability.&quot;
Japan&#x27;s JPCERT/CC has also acknowledged active abuse, stating &quot;cases of receiving unauthorized packets to certain ports have been confirmed in domestic customer environments&quot; and that the activity took place after April 2025.
Based on the information provided in the advisory, it appears that the vulnerability is being exploited to drop an unspecified backdoor on compromised systems.
In light of active exploitation efforts, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are recommended to remediate CVE-2025-61932 by November 12, 2025, to safeguard their networks.

The Iranian nation-state group known as MuddyWater has been attributed to a new campaign that has leveraged a compromised email account to distribute a backdoor called Phoenix to various organizations across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including over 100 government entities.
The end goal of the campaign is to infiltrate high-value targets and facilitate intelligence gathering, Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB said in a technical report published today.
More than three-fourths of the campaign&#x27;s targets include embassies, diplomatic missions, foreign affairs ministries, and consulates, followed by international organizations and telecommunications firms.
&quot;MuddyWater accessed the compromised mailbox through NordVPN (a legitimate service abused by the threat actor), and used it to send phishing emails that appeared to be authentic correspondence,&quot; said security researchers Mahmoud Zohdy and Mansour Alhmoud.
&quot;By exploiting the trust and authority associated with such communications, the campaign significantly increased its chances of deceiving recipients into opening the malicious attachments.&quot;
The attack chain essentially involves the threat actor distributing weaponized Microsoft Word documents that, when opened, prompt the email recipients to enable macros in order to view the content. Once the unsuspecting user enables the feature, the document proceeds to execute malicious Visual Basic for Application (VBA) code, resulting in the deployment of version 4 of the Phoenix backdoor.
The backdoor is launched by means of a loader called FakeUpdate that&#x27;s decoded and written to disk by the VBA dropper. The loader contains the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-encrypted Phoenix payload.
MuddyWater, also called Boggy Serpens, Cobalt Ulster, Earth Vetala, Mango Sandstorm (formerly Mercury), Seedworm, Static Kitten, TA450, TEMP.Zagros, and Yellow Nix, is assessed to be affiliated with Iran&#x27;s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). It&#x27;s known to be active since at least 2017.
The threat actor&#x27;s use of Phoenix was first documented by Group-IB last month, describing it as a lightweight version of BugSleep , a Python-based implant linked to MuddyWater. Two different variants of Phoenix (Version 3 and Version 4) have been detected in the wild, offering capabilities to gather system information, establish persistence, launch an interactive shell, and upload/download files.
The cybersecurity vendor said the attacker&#x27;s command-and-control (C2) server (&quot;159.198.36[.]115&quot;) has also been found hosting remote monitoring and management (RMM) utilities and a custom web browser credential stealer that targets Brave, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera, suggesting their likely use in the operation. It&#x27;s worth noting that MuddyWater has a history of distributing remote access software via phishing campaigns over the years.
&quot;By deploying updated malware variants such as the Phoenix v4 backdoor, the FakeUpdate injector, and custom credential-stealing tools alongside legitimate RMM utilities like PDQ and Action1, MuddyWater demonstrated an enhanced ability to integrate custom code with commercial tools for improved stealth and persistence,&quot; the researchers said.

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a coordinated spear-phishing campaign dubbed PhantomCaptcha targeting organizations associated with Ukraine&#x27;s war relief efforts to deliver a remote access trojan that uses a WebSocket for command-and-control (C2).
The activity, which took place on October 8, 2025, targeted individual members of the International Red Cross, Norwegian Refugee Council, United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) Ukraine office, Norwegian Refugee Council, Council of Europe&#x27;s Register of Damage for Ukraine, and Ukrainian regional government administrations in the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, and Mikolaevsk regions, SentinelOne said in a new report published today.
The phishing emails have been found to impersonate the Ukrainian President&#x27;s Office, carrying a booby-trapped PDF document that contains an embedded link, which, when clicked, redirects victims to a fake Zoom site (&quot;zoomconference[.]app&quot;) and tricks them into running a malicious PowerShell command via a ClickFix - style fake Cloudflare CAPTCHA page under the guise of a browser check.
The bogus Cloudflare page acts as an intermediary by setting up a WebSocket connection with an attacker-controlled server, and transmits a JavaScript-generated clientId, with the browser taking the victim to a legitimate, password-protected Zoom meeting if the WebSocket server responds with a matching identifier.
It&#x27;s suspected that this infection path is likely reserved for live social engineering calls with victims, although SentinelOne said it did not observe the threat actors activating this line of attack during its investigation.
The PowerShell command executed after it&#x27;s pasted to the Windows Run dialog leads to an obfuscated downloader that&#x27;s primarily responsible for retrieving and executing a second-stage payload from a remote server. This second-stage malware performs reconnaissance of the compromised host and sends it to the same server, which then responds with the PowerShell remote access trojan.
&quot;The final payload is a WebSocket RAT hosted on Russian-owned infrastructure that enables arbitrary remote command execution, data exfiltration, and potential deployment of additional malware,&quot; security researcher Tom Hegel said. &quot;The WebSocket-based RAT is a remote command execution backdoor, effectively a remote shell that gives an operator arbitrary access to the host.&quot;
The malware connects to a remote WebSocket server at &quot;wss://bsnowcommunications[.]com:80&quot; and is configured to receive Base64-encoded JSON messages that include a command to be executed with Invoke-Expression or run a PowerShell payload. The results of the execution are subsequently packaged into a JSON string and sent to the server over the WebSocket.
Further analysis of VirusTotal submissions has determined that the 8-page weaponized PDF has been uploaded from multiple locations, including Ukraine, India, Italy, and Slovakia, likely indicating broad targeting.
SentinelOne noted that preparations for the campaign began on March 27, 2025, when the attackers registered the domain &quot;goodhillsenterprise[.]com,&quot; which has been used to serve the obfuscated PowerShell malware scripts. Interestingly, the infrastructure associated with &quot;zoomconference[.]app&quot; is said to have been active only for a single day on October 8.
This suggests &quot;sophisticated planning and strong commitment to operational security,&quot; the company pointed out, adding it also uncovered fake applications hosted on the domain &quot;princess-mens[.]click&quot; that are aimed at collecting geolocation, contacts, call logs, media files, device information, installed apps list, and other data from compromised Android devices.
The campaign has not been attributed to any known threat actor or group, although the use of ClickFix overlaps with that of recently disclosed attacks mounted by the Russia-linked COLDRIVER hacking group.
&quot;The PhantomCaptcha campaign reflects a highly capable adversary, demonstrating extensive operational planning, compartmentalized infrastructure, and deliberate exposure control,&quot; SentinelOne said.
&quot;The six-month period between initial infrastructure registration and attack execution, followed by the swift takedown of user-facing domains while maintaining backend command-and-control, underscores an operator well-versed in both offensive tradecraft and defensive detection evasion.&quot;

Threat actors with ties to China exploited the ToolShell security vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to breach a telecommunications company in the Middle East after it was publicly disclosed and patched in July 2025.
Also targeted were government departments in an African country, as well as government agencies in South America, a university in the U.S., as well as likely a state technology agency in an African country, a government department in the Middle East, and a finance company in a European country.
According to Broadcom&#x27;s Symantec Threat Hunter Team, the attacks involved the exploitation of CVE-2025-53770 , a now-patched security flaw in on-premise SharePoint servers that could be used to bypass authentication and achieve remote code execution.
CVE-2025-53770, assessed to be a patch bypass for CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, has been weaponized as a zero-day by three Chinese threat groups , including Linen Typhoon (aka Budworm), Violet Typhoon (aka Sheathminer), and Storm-2603, the latter of which is linked to the deployment of Warlock, LockBit, and Babuk ransomware families in recent months.
However, the latest findings from Symantec indicate that a much wider range of Chinese threat actors have abused the vulnerability. This includes the Salt Typhoon (aka Glowworm) hacking group, which is said to have leveraged the ToolShell flaw to deploy tools like Zingdoor , ShadowPad , and KrustyLoader against the telecom entity and the two government bodies in Africa.
KrustyLoader, first detailed by Synacktiv in January 2024, is a Rust-based loader previously put to use by a China-nexus espionage group dubbed UNC5221 in attacks exploiting flaws in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile ( EPMM ) and SAP NetWeaver .
The attacks aimed at government agencies in South America and a university in the U.S., on the other hand, involved the use of unspecified vulnerabilities to obtain initial access, followed by the exploitation of SQL servers and Apache HTTP servers running the Adobe ColdFusion software to deliver the malicious payloads using DLL side-loading techniques.
In some of the incidents, the attackers have been observed executing an exploit for CVE-2021-36942 (aka PetitPotam) for privilege escalation and domain compromise, along with a number of readily available and living-off-the-land (LotL) tools to facilitate scanning, file download, and credential theft on the infected systems.
&quot;There is some overlap in the types of victims and some of the tools used between this activity and activity previously attributed to Glowworm,&quot; Symantec said. &quot;However, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclusively attribute this activity to one specific group, though we can say that all evidence points to those behind it being China-based threat actors.&quot;
&quot;The activity carried out on targeted networks indicates that the attackers were interested in stealing credentials and in establishing persistent and stealthy access to victim networks, likely for the purpose of espionage.&quot;

From Detection to Resolution: Why the Gap Persists
A critical vulnerability is identified in an exposed cloud asset. Within hours, five different tools alert you about it: your vulnerability scanner, XDR, CSPM, SIEM, and CMDB each surface the issue in their own way, with different severity levels, metadata, and context.
What&#x27;s missing is a system of action. How do you transition from the detection and identification of a security issue to remediation and resolution?
The Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) framework was introduced to help organizations address this challenge, calling for a repeatable approach to scoping, discovery, validation, and ultimately, the mobilization of remediation efforts. The goal is not just to identify risk, but to act on it, continuously and at scale.
In most environments, that mobilization happens, but it relies on manual processes. Findings remain fragmented across tools, each with its own format, language, and logic. The responsibility to consolidate, correlate, prioritize, and assign remediation tasks often falls to already stretched security operations teams. And when fixes are eventually applied, there is often no mechanism in place to validate that your actions were effective.
What we&#x27;ve seen across more than 1,200 customers is that existing processes are not built to scale across the thousands of alerts enterprise security teams contend with on a weekly basis. Security and operations teams are not set up for success here.
This disconnect between identifying risk and resolving it efficiently and reliably is the remediation gap. It is not a visibility problem. It is an operational one.
Pentera Resolve: Operationalizing Validated Risk
As the leader in Security Validation, Pentera has always focused on helping organizations understand which vulnerabilities truly matter. By safely emulating real-world attacks, we don&#x27;t simply identify what is potentially exposed, but rather how those exposures can be exploited within the context of your environment.
Now we are extending that leadership by bridging security validation with automated remediation operations, closing the gap between insight and action. Alerts alone do not reduce risk. Their value depends entirely on the organization&#x27;s ability to act on them. Ten overlapping reports sitting unread on a dashboard do not make you safer. Action does.
Introducing Pentera Resolve . Our new product marks a shift in what organizations should expect from a Security Validation platform , integrating remediation workflows natively into the validation lifecycle.
Pentera Resolve automates the remediation workflow by turning validated findings into structured tasks and routing them directly to the teams responsible for fixing them. Security teams no longer need to comb through multiple reports, chase down asset owners, or track remediation progress across disconnected dashboards. Pentera Resolve removes that friction with a streamlined process embedded in the systems organizations already use.
Powered by AI, it automates triage, prioritization, and ownership assignment. Each validated issue is enriched with business and asset context, delivered into platforms like ServiceNow, Jira, and Slack. Each ticket is tracked and cataloged, ensuring audit-ready proof-of-fix. This creates a system of record for remediation, providing security, IT, and compliance teams a shared and verifiable view of progress, all within the tools they already use. As the platform evolves, Pentera Resolve will support triggering re-tests to determine whether the original validated risk has been fully addressed.
The result is faster, simpler, and more accountable remediation. Every issue is tied to real exploitability, verified after resolution, and fully measurable from start to finish.
This level of operational integration supports something broader. It is not just about fixing what has been found. It is about enabling security programs to run remediation as a continuous, coordinated part of enterprise risk management.
From Assessment to Resolution: A Unified Platform
Security teams no longer spend time translating findings into tickets. IT and DevOps teams no longer need to guess which exposures to prioritize. Everyone works from the same source of validated truth, inside the systems they already use.
This is not just about tooling. It is about changing how work gets done, with fewer gaps, clearer ownership, and full accountability from start to finish.
Exposure without action is just noise. Pentera Resolve brings remediation into focus. It is measurable, repeatable, and fully integrated into how teams already operate.
Validate. Remediate. Repeat.
That is the loop. And now, it runs without gaps.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new supply chain attack targeting the NuGet package manager with malicious typosquats of Nethereum , a popular Ethereum .NET integration platform, to steal victims&#x27; cryptocurrency wallet keys.
The package, Netherеum.All , has been found to harbor functionality to decode a command-and-control (C2) endpoint and exfiltrate mnemonic phrases, private keys, and keystore data, according to security company Socket.
The library was uploaded by a user named &quot; nethereumgroup &quot; on October 16, 2025. It was taken down from NuGet for violating the service&#x27;s Terms of Use four days later.
What&#x27;s notable about the NuGet package is that it swaps the last occurrence of the letter &quot;e&quot; with the Cyrillic homoglyph &quot;e&quot; (U+0435) to fool unsuspecting developers into downloading it.
In a further attempt to increase the credibility of the package, the threat actors have resorted to artificially inflating the download counts, claiming it has been downloaded 11.7 million times -- a huge red flag given that it&#x27;s unlikely for an entirely new library to rack up such a high count within a short span of time.
&quot;A threat actor can publish many versions, then script downloads of each .nupkg through the v3 flat-container or loop nuget.exe install and dotnet restore with no-cache options from cloud hosts,&quot; security researcher Kirill Boychenko said . &quot;Rotating IPs and user agents and parallelizing requests boosts volume while avoiding client caches.&quot;
&quot;The result is a package that appears &#x27;popular,&#x27; which boosts placement for searches sorted by relevance and lends a false sense of proof when developers glance at the numbers.&quot;
The main payload within the NuGet package is within a function named EIP70221TransactionService.Shuffle, which parses an XOR-encoded string to extract the C2 server (solananetworkinstance[.]info/api/gads) and exfiltrates sensitive wallet data to the attacker.
The threat actor has been found to have previously uploaded another NuGet package called &quot;NethereumNet&quot; with the same deceptive functionality at the start of the month. It has already been removed by the NuGet security team.
This is not the first homoglyph typosquat that has been spotted in the NuGet repository. In July 2024, ReversingLabs documented details of several packages that impersonated their legitimate counterparts by substituting certain elements with their equivalents to bypass casual inspection.
Unlike other open-source package repositories like PyPI, npm, Maven Central, Go Module, and RubyGems that enforce restrictions on the naming scheme to ASCII, NuGet places no such constraints other than prohibiting spaces and unsafe URL characters, opening the door to abuse.
To mitigate such risks, users should carefully scrutinize libraries before downloading them, including verifying publisher identity and sudden download surges, and monitor for anomalous network traffic.

The advice didn&#x27;t change for decades: use complex passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. The idea is to make passwords harder for hackers to crack via brute force methods. But more recent guidance shows our focus should be on password length, rather than complexity. Length is the more important security factor, and passphrases are the simplest way to get your users to create (and remember!) longer passwords.
The math that matters
When attackers steal password hashes from a breach, they brute-force by hashing millions of guesses per second until something matches. The time this takes depends on one thing: how many possible combinations exist.
A traditional 8-character &quot;complex&quot; password (P@ssw0rd!) offers roughly 218 trillion combinations. Sounds impressive until you realize modern GPU setups can test those combinations in months, not years. Increase that to 16 characters using only lowercase letters, and you&#x27;re looking at 26^16 combinations, billions of times harder to crack.
This is effective entropy: the actual randomness an attacker must work through. Three or four random common words strung together (&quot;carpet-static-pretzel-invoke&quot;) deliver far more entropy than cramming symbols into short strings. And users can actually remember them.
Why passphrases win on every front
The case for passphrases isn&#x27;t theoretical, it&#x27;s operational:
Fewer resets. When passwords are memorable, users stop writing them on Post-it notes or recycling similar variations across accounts. Your helpdesk tickets drop, which alone should justify the change.
Better attack resistance. Attackers optimize for patterns. They test dictionary words with common substitutions (@ for a, 0 for o) because that&#x27;s what people do. A four-word passphrase sidesteps these patterns entirely – but only when the words are truly random and unrelated.
Aligned with current guidance. NIST has been clear : prioritize length over forced complexity. The traditional 8-character minimum should really be a thing of the past.
One rule worth following
Stop managing 47 password requirements. Give users one clear instruction:
Choose 3-4 unrelated common words + a separator. Avoid song lyrics, proper names, or famous phrases. Never reuse across accounts.
Examples: mango-glacier-laptop-furnace or cricket.highway.mustard.piano
That&#x27;s it. No mandatory capitals, no required symbols, no complexity theater. Just length and randomness.
Rolling it out without chaos
Changes to authentication can spark resistance. Here&#x27;s how to minimize friction:
Start with a pilot group, grab 50-100 users from different departments. Give them the new guidance and monitor (but don&#x27;t enforce) for two weeks. Watch for patterns: Are people defaulting to phrases from pop culture? Are they hitting minimum length requirements consistently?
Then move to warn-only mode across the organization. Users see alerts when their new passphrase is weak or has been compromised, but they&#x27;re not blocked. This builds awareness without creating support bottlenecks.
Enforce only after you&#x27;ve measured:
Track these as KPIs. They&#x27;ll tell you whether this is working better than the old policy.
Making it stick with the right policy tools
Your Active Directory password policy needs three updates to support passphrases properly:
Self-service password reset (SSPR) can help during the transition. Users can securely update credentials on their own time, and your helpdesk shouldn&#x27;t be the bottleneck.
Password auditing gives you visibility into adoption rates. You can identify accounts still using short passwords or common patterns, then target those users with additional guidance.
Tools like Specops Password Policy handle all three functions: extending policy minimums, blocking over 4 billion compromised passwords, and integrating with SSPR workflows. The policy updates sync to Active Directory and Azure AD without additional infrastructure, and the blocklist updates daily as new breaches emerge.
What this looks like in practice
Imagine your policy requires 15 characters but drops all complexity rules. A user creates umbrella-coaster-fountain-sketch during their next password change. A tool like Specops Password Policy checks it against the compromised password database – it&#x27;s clean. The user remembers it without a password manager because it&#x27;s four concrete images linked together. They don&#x27;t reuse it because they know it&#x27;s specific to this account.
Six months later, no reset request. No Post-it note and no call to the helpdesk because they fat-fingered a symbol. Nothing revolutionary – just simple and effective.
The security you actually need
Passphrases aren&#x27;t a silver bullet. MFA still matters . Compromised credential monitoring still matters. But if you&#x27;re spending resources on password policy changes, this is where to spend it: longer minimums, simpler rules, and real protection against breached credentials.
Attackers still steal hashes and brute-force them offline. What&#x27;s changed is our understanding of what actually slows them down, so your next password policy should reflect that. Interested in giving it a try? Book a live demo of Specops Password Policy .

Government, financial, and industrial organizations located in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the target of a new campaign dubbed PassiveNeuron , according to findings from Kaspersky.
The cyber espionage activity was first flagged by the Russian cybersecurity vendor in November 2024, when it disclosed a set of attacks aimed at government entities in Latin America and East Asia in June, using never-before-seen malware families tracked as Neursite and NeuralExecutor.
It also described the operation as exhibiting a high level of sophistication, with the threat actors leveraging already compromised internal servers as an intermediate command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to fly under the radar.
&quot;The threat actor is able to move laterally through the infrastructure and exfiltrate data, optionally creating virtual networks that allow attackers to steal files of interest even from machines isolated from the internet,&quot; Kaspersky noted at the time. &quot;A plugin-based approach provides dynamic adaptation to the attacker&#x27;s needs.&quot;
Since then, the company said it has observed a fresh wave of infections related to PassiveNeuron since December 2024 and continuing all the way through August 2025. The campaign remains unattributed at this stage, although some signs point to it being the work of Chinese-speaking threat actors.
In at least one incident, the adversary is said to have gained initial remote command execution capabilities on a compromised machine running Windows Server through Microsoft SQL. While the exact method by which this is achieved is not known, it&#x27;s possible that the attackers are either brute-forcing the administration account password, or leveraging an SQL injection flaw in an application running on the server, or an as-yet-undetermined vulnerability in the server software itself.
Regardless of the method used, the attackers attempted to deploy an ASPX web shell to gain basic command execution capabilities. Failing in these efforts, the intrusion witnessed the delivery of advanced implants via a series of DLL loaders placed in the System32 directory. These include -
Neursite utilizes an embedded configuration to connect to the C2 server and uses TCP, SSL, HTTP and HTTPS protocols for communications. By default, it supports the ability to gather system information, manage running processes, and proxy traffic through other machines infected with the backdoor to enable lateral movement.
The malware also comes fitted with a component to fetch auxiliary plugins to achieve shell command execution, file system management, and TCP socket operations.
Kaspersky also noted that NeuralExecutor variants spotted in 2024 were designed to retrieve the C2 server addresses straight from the configuration, whereas artifacts found this year reach out to a GitHub repository to obtain the C2 server address, effectively turning the legitimate code hosting platform into a dead drop resolver.
&quot;The PassiveNeuron campaign has been distinctive in the way that it primarily targets server machines,&quot; researchers Georgy Kucherin and Saurabh Sharma said. &quot;These servers, especially the ones exposed to the internet, are usually lucrative targets for [advanced persistent threats], as they can serve as entry points into target organizations.&quot;

Government, financial, and industrial organizations located in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the target of a new campaign dubbed PassiveNeuron , according to findings from Kaspersky.
The cyber espionage activity was first flagged by the Russian cybersecurity vendor in November 2024, when it disclosed a set of attacks aimed at government entities in Latin America and East Asia in June, using never-before-seen malware families tracked as Neursite and NeuralExecutor.
It also described the operation as exhibiting a high level of sophistication, with the threat actors leveraging already compromised internal servers as an intermediate command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to fly under the radar.
&quot;The threat actor is able to move laterally through the infrastructure and exfiltrate data, optionally creating virtual networks that allow attackers to steal files of interest even from machines isolated from the internet,&quot; Kaspersky noted at the time. &quot;A plugin-based approach provides dynamic adaptation to the attacker&#x27;s needs.&quot;
Since then, the company said it has observed a fresh wave of infections related to PassiveNeuron since December 2024 and continuing all the way through August 2025. The campaign remains unattributed at this stage, although some signs point to it being the work of Chinese-speaking threat actors.
In at least one incident, the adversary is said to have gained initial remote command execution capabilities on a compromised machine running Windows Server through Microsoft SQL. While the exact method by which this is achieved is not known, it&#x27;s possible that the attackers are either brute-forcing the administration account password, or leveraging an SQL injection flaw in an application running on the server, or an as-yet-undetermined vulnerability in the server software itself.
Regardless of the method used, the attackers attempted to deploy an ASPX web shell to gain basic command execution capabilities. Failing in these efforts, the intrusion witnessed the delivery of advanced implants via a series of DLL loaders placed in the System32 directory. These include -
Neursite utilizes an embedded configuration to connect to the C2 server and uses TCP, SSL, HTTP and HTTPS protocols for communications. By default, it supports the ability to gather system information, manage running processes, and proxy traffic through other machines infected with the backdoor to enable lateral movement.
The malware also comes fitted with a component to fetch auxiliary plugins to achieve shell command execution, file system management, and TCP socket operations.
Kaspersky also noted that NeuralExecutor variants spotted in 2024 were designed to retrieve the C2 server addresses straight from the configuration, whereas artifacts found this year reach out to a GitHub repository to obtain the C2 server address, effectively turning the legitimate code hosting platform into a dead drop resolver.
&quot;The PassiveNeuron campaign has been distinctive in the way that it primarily targets server machines,&quot; researchers Georgy Kucherin and Saurabh Sharma said. &quot;These servers, especially the ones exposed to the internet, are usually lucrative targets for [advanced persistent threats], as they can serve as entry points into target organizations.&quot;

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a high-severity flaw impacting the popular async-tar Rust library and its forks, including tokio-tar, that could result in remote code execution under certain conditions.
The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-62518 (CVSS score: 8.1), has been codenamed TARmageddon by Edera, which discovered the issue in late August 2025. It impacts several widely-used projects, such as testcontainers and wasmCloud.
&quot;In the worst-case scenario, this vulnerability has a severity of 8.1 (High) and can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) through file overwriting attacks, such as replacing configuration files or hijacking build backends,&quot; the Seattle-based security company said .
The problem is compounded by the fact that tokio-tar is essentially abandonware despite attracting thousands of downloads via crates.io. Tokio-tar is a Rust library for asynchronously reading and writing TAR archives built atop the Tokio runtime for the programming language. The Rust crate was last updated on July 15, 2023.
In the absence of a patch for tokio-tar, users relying on the library are advised to migrate to astral-tokio-tar, which has released version 0.5.6 to remediate the flaw.
&quot;Versions of astral-tokio-tar prior to 0.5.6 contain a boundary parsing vulnerability that allows attackers to smuggle additional archive entries by exploiting inconsistent PAX/ustar header handling,&quot; Astral developer William Woodruff said in an alert.
&quot;When processing archives with PAX-extended headers containing size overrides, the parser incorrectly advances stream position based on ustar header size (often zero) instead of the PAX-specified size, causing it to interpret file content as legitimate TAR headers.&quot;
The issue, in a nutshell, is the result of inconsistent handling when handling PAX extended headers and ustar headers when determining file data boundaries. PAX, short for portable archive interchange, is an extended version of the USTAR format used to store properties of member files in a TAR archive.
The mismatch between a PAX extended headers and ustar headers – where the PAX header correctly specifies the file size, whereas the ustar header incorrectly specifies the file size as zero (instead of the PAX size) – leads to a parsing inconsistency, causing the library to interpret the inner content as additional outer archive entries.
&quot;By advancing 0 bytes, the parser fails to skip over the actual file data (which is a nested TAR archive) and immediately encounters the next valid TAR header located at the start of the nested archive,&quot; Edera explained. &quot;It then incorrectly interprets the inner archive&#x27;s headers as legitimate entries belonging to the outer archive.&quot;
As a result, an attacker could exploit this behavior to &quot;smuggle&quot; extra archives when the library is processing nested TAR files, thereby making it possible to overwrite files within extraction directories, ultimately paving the way for arbitrary code execution.
In a hypothetical attack scenario, an attacker could upload a specially-crafted package to PyPI such that the outer TAR contains a legitimate pyproject.toml, whereas the hidden inner TAR contains a malicious one that hijacks the build backend and overwrites the actual file during installation.
&quot;While Rust&#x27;s guarantees make it significantly harder to introduce memory safety bugs (like buffer overflows or use-after-free), it does not eliminate logic bugs – and this parsing inconsistency is fundamentally a logic flaw,&quot; Edera said. &quot;Developers must remain vigilant against all classes of vulnerabilities, regardless of the language used.&quot;

Meta on Tuesday said it&#x27;s launching new tools to protect Messenger and WhatsApp users from potential scams.
To that end, the company said it&#x27;s introducing new warnings on WhatsApp when users attempt to share their screen with an unknown contact during a video call so as to prevent them from giving away sensitive information like bank details or verification codes.
On Messenger, users can opt to enable a setting called &quot;Scam detection&quot; by navigating to Privacy &amp; safety settings. Once it&#x27;s turned on, users are alerted when they receive a potentially suspicious message from an unknown connection that may contain signs of a scam.
&quot;Because detection happens on your device, chats with end-to-end encryption stay secure,&quot; Meta said in a support document. &quot;If you&#x27;re notified that a chat may contain signs of a scam, we&#x27;ll ask if you&#x27;d like to send recent messages you received to AI review. Messages that are shared with AI are no longer end-to-end encrypted.&quot;
If the review finds that it&#x27;s indeed a possible scam, users are given more information about common scams, such as job offers in exchange for money, opportunities promising fast cash, and work-from-home offers for jobs that can&#x27;t possibly be done remotely. Users are also provided options to block or report the account in question.
As part of its ongoing efforts to combat scams, the social media giant said it took action on over 21,000 Facebook Pages and accounts masquerading as customer support in an attempt to trick people into sharing their personal information.
In addition, Meta said it detected and disrupted close to 8 million accounts on Facebook and Instagram since the start of the year that are associated with criminal scam centers targeting people, including the elderly, across the world through messaging, dating apps, social media, crypto, and other apps. The scam compounds operated out of Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Philippines.
These schemes, often called romance baiting (aka pig butchering), are run by cybercrime syndicates based out of Southeast Asia and refer to a type of investment fraud where criminals entice victims into depositing ever-larger sums into bogus platforms with promises of bigger returns.
In many of the cases, the scammers – who are themselves trafficked into the region with lures of high-paying jobs and held against their will – initiate contact with victims through dating apps, social media platforms, or private messaging services like WhatsApp.
Once they establish rapport, the operation moves to the next phase, with the threat actors steering victims toward supposed investment opportunities, often tied to cryptocurrencies, and deceiving them into depositing their funds and ultimately disappearing without a trace.
&quot;Central to the scam is psychological manipulation: perpetrators cultivate emotional bonds, instill confidence, and in some cases even simulate romantic relationships,&quot; Infoblox noted in an analysis published earlier this month. &quot;This drawn-out grooming process lowers victims&#x27; defenses and primes them to believe in promises of extraordinary returns, leading to devastating financial losses.&quot;

Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on the inner workings of a botnet malware called PolarEdge .
PolarEdge was first documented by Sekoia in February 2025, attributing it to a campaign targeting routers from Cisco, ASUS, QNAP, and Synology with the goal of corralling them into a network for an as-yet-undetermined purpose.
The TLS-based ELF implant, at its core, is designed to monitor incoming client connections and execute commands within them.
Then, in August 2025, attack surface management platform Censys detailed the infrastructural backbone powering the botnet, with the company noting that PolarEdge exhibits characteristics that are consistent with an Operational Relay Box (ORB) network. There is evidence to suggest that the activity involving the malware may have started as far back as June 2023.
In the attack chains observed in February 2025, the threat actors have been observed exploiting a known security flaw impacting Cisco routers (CVE-2023-20118) to download a shell script named &quot;q&quot; over FTP, which is then responsible for retrieving and executing the PolarEdge backdoor on the compromised system.
&quot;The backdoor&#x27;s primary function is to send a host fingerprint to its command-and-control server and then listen for commands over a built-in TLS server implemented with mbedTLS,&quot; the French cybersecurity company said in a technical breakdown of the malware.
PolarEdge is designed to support two modes of operation: a connect-back mode, where the backdoor acts as a TLS client to download a file from a remote server, and debug mode, where the backdoor enters into an interactive mode to modify its configuration (i.e., server information) on-the-fly.
The configuration is embedded in the final 512 bytes of the ELF image, obfuscated by a one-byte XOR that can be decrypted with single-byte key 0x11.
However, its default mode is to function as a TLS server in order to send a host fingerprint to the command-and-control (C2) server and wait for commands to be sent. The TLS server is implemented with mbedTLS v2.8.0 and relies on a custom binary protocol for parsing incoming requests matching specific criteria, including a parameter named &quot;HasCommand.&quot;
If the &quot;HasCommand&quot; parameter equals the ASCII character 1, the backdoor proceeds to extract and run the command specified in the &quot;Command&quot; field and transmits back the raw output of the executed command.
Once launched, PolarEdge also moves (e.g., /usr/bin/wget, /sbin/curl) and deletes certain files (&quot;/share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/.qpkg/CMS-WS/cgi-bin/library.cgi.bak&quot;) on the infected device, although the exact purpose behind this step is unclear.
Furthermore, the backdoor incorporates a wide range of anti-analysis techniques to obfuscate information related to the TLS server setup and fingerprinting logic. To evade detection, it employs process masquerading during its initialization phase by choosing from a predefined list a name at random. Some of the names included are: igmpproxy, wscd, /sbin/dhcpd, httpd, upnpd, and iapp.
&quot;Although the backdoor does not ensure persistence across reboots, it calls fork to spawn a child process that, every 30 seconds, checks whether /proc/&lt;parent-pid&gt; still exists,&quot; Sekoia researchers explained. &quot;If the directory has disappeared, the child executes a shell command to relaunch the backdoor.&quot;
The disclosure comes as Synthient highlighted GhostSocks&#x27; ability to convert compromised devices into SOCKS5 residential proxies. GhostSocks is said to have been first advertised under the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model on the XSS forum in October 2023.
It&#x27;s worth noting that the offering has been integrated into Lumma Stealer as of early 2024, allowing customers of the stealer malware to monetize the compromised devices post-infection.
&quot;GhostSocks provides clients with the ability to build a 32-bit DLL or executable,&quot; Synthient said in a recent analysis. &quot;GhostSocks will attempt to locate a configuration file in %TEMP%. In the scenario that the configuration file cannot be found, it will fall back to a hard-coded config.&quot;
The configuration contains details of the C2 server to which a connection is established for provisioning the SOCKS5 proxy and ultimately spawning a connection using the open-source go-socks5 and yamux libraries.

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds tremendous promise for improving cyber defense and making the lives of security practitioners easier. It can help teams cut through alert fatigue, spot patterns faster, and bring a level of scale that human analysts alone can&#x27;t match. But realizing that potential depends on securing the systems that make it possible.
Every organization experimenting with AI in security operations is, knowingly or not, expanding its attack surface. Without clear governance, strong identity controls, and visibility into how AI makes its decisions, even well-intentioned deployments can create risk faster than they reduce it. To truly benefit from AI, defenders need to approach securing it with the same rigor they apply to any other critical system. That means establishing trust in the data it learns from, accountability for the actions it takes, and oversight for the outcomes it produces. When secured correctly, AI can amplify human capability instead of replacing it to help practitioners work smarter, respond faster, and defend more effectively.
Establishing Trust for Agentic AI Systems
As organizations begin to integrate AI into defensive workflows, identity security becomes the foundation for trust. Every model, script, or autonomous agent operating in a production environment now represents a new identity — one capable of accessing data, issuing commands, and influencing defensive outcomes. If those identities aren&#x27;t properly governed, the tools meant to strengthen security can quietly become sources of risk.
The emergence of Agentic AI systems make this especially important. These systems don&#x27;t just analyze; they may act without human intervention. They triage alerts, enrich context, or trigger response playbooks under delegated authority from human operators. Each action is, in effect, a transaction of trust. That trust must be bound to identity, authenticated through policy, and auditable end to end.
The same principles that secure people and services must now apply to AI agents:
In practice, this means treating every agentic AI system as a first-class identity within your IAM framework. Each should have a defined owner, lifecycle policy, and monitoring scope just like any user or service account. Defensive teams should continuously verify what those agents can do, not just what they were intended to do, because capability often drifts faster than design. With identity established as the foundation, defenders can then turn their attention to securing the broader system.
Securing AI: Best Practices for Success
Securing AI begins with protecting the systems that make it possible — the models, data pipelines, and integrations now woven into everyday security operations. Just as
we secure networks and endpoints, AI systems must be treated as mission-critical infrastructure that requires layered and continuous defense.
The SANS Secure AI Blueprint outlines a Protect AI track that provides a clear starting point. Built on the SANS Critical AI Security Guidelines , the blueprint defines six control domains that translate directly into practice:
These controls align directly NIST&#x27;s AI Risk Management Framework and the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs , which highlights the most common and consequential vulnerabilities in AI systems — from prompt injection and insecure plugin integrations to model poisoning and data exposure. Applying mitigations from those frameworks inside these six domains helps translate guidance into operational defense. Once these foundations are in place, teams can focus on using AI responsibly by knowing when to trust automation and when to keep humans in the loop.
Balancing Augmentation and Automation
AI systems are capable of assisting human practitioners like an intern that never sleeps. However, it is critical for security teams to differentiate what to automate from what to augment. Some tasks benefit from full automation, especially those that are repeatable, measurable, and low-risk if an error occurs. However, others demand direct human oversight because context, intuition, or ethics matter more than speed.
Threat enrichment, log parsing, and alert deduplication are prime candidates for automation. These are data-heavy, pattern-driven processes where consistency outperforms creativity. By contrast, incident scoping, attribution, and response decisions rely on context that AI cannot fully grasp. Here, AI should assist by surfacing indicators, suggesting next steps, or summarizing findings while practitioners retain decision authority.
Finding that balance requires maturity in process design. Security teams should categorize workflows by their tolerance for error and the cost of automation failure. Wherever the risk of false positives or missed nuance is high, keep humans in the loop. Wherever precision can be objectively measured, let AI accelerate the work.

A new malware attributed to the Russia-linked hacking group known as COLDRIVER has undergone numerous developmental iterations since May 2025, suggesting an increased &quot;operations tempo&quot; from the threat actor.
The findings come from Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), which said the state-sponsored hacking crew has rapidly refined and retooled its malware arsenal merely five days following the publication of its LOSTKEYS malware around the same time.
While it&#x27;s currently not known for how long the new malware families have been under development, the tech giant&#x27;s threat intelligence team said it has not observed a single instance of LOSTKEYS since disclosure.
The new malware, codenamed NOROBOT, YESROBOT, and MAYBEROBOT, is &quot;a collection of related malware families connected via a delivery chain,&quot; GTIG researcher Wesley Shields said in a Monday analysis.
The latest attack waves are something of a departure from COLDRIVER&#x27;s typical modus operandi, which involves targeting high profile individuals in NGOs, policy advisors, and dissidents for credential theft. In contrast, the new activity revolves around leveraging ClickFix-style lures to trick users into running malicious PowerShell commands via the Windows Run dialog as part of a fake CAPTCHA verification prompt.
While the attacks spotted in January, March, and April 2025 led to the deployment of an information stealing malware known as LOSTKEYS, subsequent intrusions have paved the way for the &quot;ROBOT&quot; family of malware. It&#x27;s worth noting that the malware families NOROBOT and MAYBEROBOT are tracked by Zscaler ThreatLabz under the names BAITSWITCH and SIMPLEFIX , respectively.
The new infection chain commences with an HTML ClickFix lure dubbed COLDCOPY that&#x27;s designed to drop a DLL called NOROBOT , which is then executed via rundll32.exe to drop the next-stage malware. Initial versions of this attack is said to have distributed a Python backdoor known as YESROBOT , before the threat actors switch to a Powershell implant named MAYBEROBOT .
YESROBOT uses HTTPS to retrieve commands from a hard-coded command-and-control (C2) server. A minimal backdoor, it supports the ability to download and execute files, and retrieve documents of interest. Only two instances of YESROBOT deployment have been observed to date, specifically over a two week period in late May shortly after details of LOSTKEYS became public knowledge.
In contrast, MAYBEROBOT is assessed to be more flexible and extensible, equipped with features to download and run payload from a specified URL, run commands using cmd.exe, and run PowerShell code.
It&#x27;s believed that the COLDRIVER actors rushed to deploy YESROBOT as a &quot;stopgap mechanism&quot; likely in response to public disclosure, before abandoning it in favor of MAYBEROBOT, as the earliest version of NOROBOT also included a step to download a full Python 3.8 installation onto the compromised host -- a &quot;noisy&quot; artifact that&#x27;s bound to raise suspicion.
Google also pointed out that the use of NOROBOT and MAYBEROBOT is likely reserved for significant targets, who may have been already compromised via phishing, with the end goal of gathering additional intelligence from their devices.
&quot;NOROBOT and its preceding infection chain have been subject to constant evolution -- initially simplified to increase chances of successful deployment, before re-introducing complexity by splitting cryptography keys,&quot; Shields said. &quot;This constant development highlights the group&#x27;s efforts to evade detection systems for their delivery mechanism for continued intelligence collection against high-value targets.&quot;
The disclosure comes as the Netherlands&#x27; Public Prosecution Service, known as the Openbaar Ministerie (OM), announced that three 17-year-old men have been suspected of providing services to a foreign government, with one of them alleged to be in contact with a hacker group affiliated with the Russian government.
&quot;This suspect also gave the other two instructions to map Wi-Fi networks on multiple dates in The Hague,&quot; OM said . &quot;The information collected has been shared with the client by the former suspect for a fee and can be used for digital espionage and cyber attacks.&quot;
Two of the suspects were apprehended on September 22, 2025, while the third suspect, who was also interviewed by authorities, has been kept under house arrest because of his &quot;limited role&quot; in the case.
&quot;There are no indications yet that pressure has been exerted on the suspect who was in contact with the hacker group affiliated with the Russian government,&quot; the Dutch government body added.

A European telecommunications organization is said to have been targeted by a threat actor that aligns with a China-nexus cyber espionage group known as Salt Typhoon .
The organization, per Darktrace , was targeted in the first week of July 2025, with the attackers exploiting a Citrix NetScaler Gateway appliance to obtain initial access.
Salt Typhoon, also known as Earth Estries, FamousSparrow, GhostEmperor, and UNC5807, is the name given to an advanced persistent threat actor with ties to China. Known to be active since 2019, the group gained prominence last year following its attacks on telecommunications services providers, energy networks, and government systems in the U.S.
The adversary has a track record of exploiting security flaws in edge devices, maintaining deep persistence, and exfiltrating sensitive data from victims in more than 80 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
In the incident observed against the European telecommunications entity, the attackers are said to have leveraged the foothold to pivot to Citrix Virtual Delivery Agent (VDA) hosts in the client&#x27;s Machine Creation Services (MCS) subnet, while also using SoftEther VPN to obscure their true origins.
One of the malware families delivered as part of the attack is Snappybee (aka Deed RAT), a suspected successor to the ShadowPad (aka PoisonPlug) malware that has been deployed in prior Salt Typhoon attacks . The malware is launched by means of a technique called DLL side-loading, which has been adopted by a number of Chinese hacking groups over the years.
&quot;The backdoor was delivered to these internal endpoints as a DLL alongside legitimate executable files for antivirus software such as Norton Antivirus, Bkav Antivirus, and IObit Malware Fighter,&quot; Darktrace said. &quot;This pattern of activity indicates that the attacker relied on DLL side-loading via legitimate antivirus software to execute their payloads.&quot;
The malware is designed to contact an external server (&quot;aar.gandhibludtric[.]com&quot;) over HTTP and an unidentified TCP-based protocol. Darktrace said the intrusion activity was identified and remediated before it could escalate further.
&quot;Salt Typhoon continues to challenge defenders with its stealth, persistence, and abuse of legitimate tools,&quot; the company added. &quot;The evolving nature of Salt Typhoon&#x27;s tradecraft, and its ability to repurpose trusted software and infrastructure, ensures it will remain difficult to detect using conventional methods alone.&quot;

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Monday added five security flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) Catalog, officially confirming a recently disclosed vulnerability impacting Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) has been weaponized in real-world attacks.
The security defect in question is CVE-2025-61884 (CVSS score: 7.5), which has been described as a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Runtime component of Oracle Configurator that could allow attackers unauthorized access to critical data.
&quot;This vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication,&quot; CISA said.
CVE-2025-61884 is the second flaw in Oracle EBS to be actively exploited along with CVE-2025-61882 (CVSS score: 9.8), a critical bug that could permit unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on susceptible instances.
Earlier this month, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant revealed dozens of organizations may have been impacted following the exploitation of CVE-2025-61882.
&quot;At this time, we are not able to attribute any specific exploitation activity to a specific actor, but it&#x27;s likely that at least some of the exploitation activity we observed was conducted by actors now conducting Cl0p-branded extortion operations,&quot; Zander Work, senior security engineer at GTIG, told The Hacker News last week.
Also added by CISA to the KEV catalog are four other vulnerabilities -
There are currently no details on how the aforementioned four issues are being exploited in the wild, although details about CVE-2025-33073, CVE-2025-2746, and CVE-2025-2747 were shared by researchers from Synacktiv and watchTowr Labs , respectively.
GuidePoint Security researcher Cameron Stish, who also independently reported CVE-2025-33073 (aka the Reflective Kerberos relay attack or LoopyTicket), alongside CrowdStrike, SySS GmbH, RedTeam Pentesting GmbH, Google Project Zero, and Ahamada M&#x27;Bamba, said the vulnerability could be exploited to obtain elevated code execution on a domain controller if SMB signing is not enforced.
Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to remediate identified vulnerabilities by November 10, 2025, to secure their networks against active threats.

It&#x27;s easy to think your defenses are solid — until you realize attackers have been inside them the whole time. The latest incidents show that long-term, silent breaches are becoming the norm. The best defense now isn&#x27;t just patching fast, but watching smarter and staying alert for what you don&#x27;t expect.
Here&#x27;s a quick look at this week&#x27;s top threats, new tactics, and security stories shaping the landscape.
⚡ Threat of the Week
F5 Exposed to Nation-State Breach — F5 disclosed that unidentified threat actors broke into its systems and stole files containing some of BIG-IP&#x27;s source code and information related to undisclosed vulnerabilities in the product. The company said it learned of the incident on August 9, 2025, although it&#x27;s believed that the attackers were in its network for at least 12 months. The attackers are said to have used a malware family called BRICKSTORM, which is attributed to a China-nexus espionage group dubbed UNC5221. GreyNoise said it observed elevated scanning activity targeting BIG-IP in three waves on September 23, October 14, and October 15, 2025, but emphasized the anomalies may not necessarily relate to the hack. Censys said it identified over 680,000 F5 BIG-IP load balancers and application gateways visible on the public internet, with the majority of hosts located in the U.S., followed by Germany, France, Japan, and China. Not all identified systems are necessarily vulnerable, but each represents a publicly accessible interface that should be inventoried, access-restricted, and patched proactively as a precautionary measure. &quot;Edge infrastructure and security vendors remain prime targets for long-term, often state-linked threat actors,&quot; John Fokker, vice president of threat intelligence strategy at Trellix, said. &quot;Over the years, we have seen nation-state interest in exploiting vulnerabilities in edge devices, recognizing their strategic position in global networks. Incidents like these remind us that strengthening collective resilience requires not only hardened technology but also open collaboration and intelligence sharing across the security community.&quot;

Hackers move fast. They often exploit new vulnerabilities within hours, turning a single missed patch into a major breach. One unpatched CVE can be all it takes for a full compromise. Below are this week&#x27;s most critical vulnerabilities gaining attention across the industry. Review them, prioritize your fixes, and close the gap before attackers take advantage.
This week&#x27;s list includes — CVE-2025-24990, CVE-2025-59230 (Microsoft Windows), CVE-2025-47827 (IGEL OS before 11), CVE-2023-42770, CVE-2023-40151 (Red Lion Sixnet RTUs), CVE-2025-2611 (ICTBroadcast), CVE-2025-55315 (Microsoft ASP.NET Core), CVE-2025-11577 (Clevo UEFI firmware), CVE-2025-37729 (Elastic Cloud Enterprise), CVE-2025-9713, CVE-2025-11622 ( Ivanti Endpoint Manager ), CVE-2025-48983 , CVE-2025-48984 (Veeam), CVE-2025-11756 (Google Chrome), CVE-2025-49201 (Fortinet FortiPAM and FortiSwitch Manager), CVE-2025-58325 (Fortinet FortiOS CLI), CVE-2025-49553 (Adobe Connect collaboration suite), CVE-2025-9217 (Slider Revolution plugin), CVE-2025-10230 (Samba), CVE-2025-54539 (Apache ActiveMQ), CVE-2025-41703, CVE-2025-41704, CVE-2025-41706, CVE-2025-41707 (Phoenix Contact QUINT4), and CVE-2025-11492, CVE-2025-11493 (ConnectWise Automate).

🔒 Tip of the Week
Most Cloud Breaches Aren&#x27;t Hacks — They&#x27;re Misconfigurations. Here&#x27;s How to Fix Them — Cloud storage buckets like AWS S3, Azure Blob, and Google Cloud Storage make data sharing easy — but one wrong setting can expose everything. Most data leaks happen not because of hacking, but because someone left a public bucket, skipped encryption, or used a test bucket that never got locked down. Cloud platforms give you flexibility, not guaranteed safety, so you need to check and control access yourself.
Misconfigurations usually happen when permissions are too broad, encryption is disabled, or visibility is lost across multiple clouds. Doing manual checks doesn&#x27;t scale — especially if you manage data in AWS, Azure, and GCP. The fix is using tools that automatically find, report, and even fix unsafe settings before they cause damage.
ScoutSuite is a strong starting point for cross-cloud visibility. It scans AWS, Azure, and GCP for open buckets, weak IAM roles, and missing encryption, then creates an easy-to-read HTML report. **Prowler** goes deeper into AWS, checking S3 settings against CIS and AWS benchmarks to catch bad ACLs or unencrypted buckets.
For ongoing control, Cloud Custodian lets you write simple policies that automatically enforce rules — for example, forcing all new buckets to use encryption. And CloudQuery can turn your cloud setup into a searchable database, so you can monitor changes, track compliance, and visualize risks in one place.
The best approach is to combine them: run ScoutSuite or Prowler weekly to find issues, and let Cloud Custodian handle automatic fixes. Even a few hours spent setting these up can stop the kind of data leaks that make headlines. Always assume every bucket is public until proven otherwise — and secure it like it is.
Conclusion
The truth is, no tool or patch will ever make us fully secure. What matters most is awareness — knowing what&#x27;s normal, what&#x27;s changing, and how attackers think. Every alert, log, or minor anomaly is a clue. Keep connecting those dots before someone else does.

ClickFix, FileFix, fake CAPTCHA — whatever you call it, attacks where users interact with malicious scripts in their web browser are a fast-growing source of security breaches.
ClickFix attacks prompt the user to solve some kind of problem or challenge in the browser — most commonly a CAPTCHA, but also things like fixing an error on a webpage.
The name is a little misleading, though — the key factor in the attack is that they trick users into running malicious commands on their device by copying malicious code from the page clipboard and running it locally.
ClickFix is known to be regularly used by the Interlock ransomware group and other prolific threat actors, including state-sponsored APTs. A number of recent public data breaches have been linked to ClickFix-style TTPs, such as Kettering Health, DaVita, City of St. Paul, Minnesota, and the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Centers (with many more breaches likely to involve ClickFix where the attack vector wasn&#x27;t known or disclosed).
But why are these attacks proving to be so effective?
Reason 1: Users aren&#x27;t ready for ClickFix
For the past decade or more, user awareness has focused on stopping users from clicking links in suspicious emails, downloading risky files, and entering their username and password into random websites. It hasn&#x27;t focused on opening up a program and running a command.
Suspicion is further reduced when you consider that the malicious clipboard copy action is performed behind the scenes via JavaScript 99% of the time.
And with modern ClickFix sites and lures becoming increasingly legitimate-looking (see the example below), it&#x27;s not surprising that users are falling victim.
When you consider the fact that these attacks are moving away from email altogether, it doesn&#x27;t fit the model of what users are trained to be suspicious of.
The top delivery vector identified by Push Security researchers was found to be SEO poisoning &amp; malvertising via Google Search. By creating new domains or taking over legitimate ones, attackers are creating watering hole scenarios to intercept users browsing the internet.
And even if you were suspicious, there&#x27;s no convenient &quot;report phishing&quot; button or workflow to notify your security team for Google Search results, social media messages, website ads, and so on.
Reason 2: ClickFix isn&#x27;t being detected during delivery
There are a few aspects of why ClickFix attacks are going undetected by technical controls.
ClickFix pages, like other modern phishing sites, are using a range of detection evasion techniques that prevent them from being flagged by security tools — from email scanners, to web-crawling security tools, to web proxies analyzing network traffic. Detection evasion mainly involves camouflaging and rotating domains to stay ahead of known-bad detections (i.e., blocklists), using bot protection to prevent analysis, and heavily obfuscating page content to stop detection signatures from firing.
And by using non-email delivery vectors, an entire layer of detection opportunity is cut out .
Malvertising adds another layer of targeting to the picture. For example, Google Ads can be targeted to searches coming from specific geographic locations, tailored to specific email domain matches, or specific device types (e.g. desktop, mobile, etc.). If you know where your target is located, you can tailor the ad parameters accordingly.
Along with other techniques, like conditional loading to return a lure appropriate for your operating system (or not triggering at all unless certain conditions are met, e.g. you&#x27;re visiting from a mobile OS, or from outside a target IP range) attackers have a way of reaching a large number of potential victims while avoiding security controls at the email layer and preventing unwanted analysis.
Finally, because the code is copied inside the browser sandbox, typical security tools are unable to observe and flag this action as potentially malicious. This means that the last — and only — opportunity for organizations to stop ClickFix is on the endpoint, after the user has attempted to run the malicious code.
Reason 3: EDR is the last and only line of defense — and it&#x27;s not foolproof
There are multiple stages to the attack that can and should be intercepted by EDR, but the level of detection raised, and whether an action is blocked in real time, is driven by context.
Because there&#x27;s no file download from the web, and the act of running code on the machine is initiated by the user, there&#x27;s no context tying the action to another application to make it appear suspicious. For example, malicious PowerShell executed from Outlook or Chrome would appear obviously suspicious, but because it&#x27;s user-initiated, it&#x27;s isolated from the context of where the code was delivered.
The malicious commands themselves might be obfuscated or broken into stages to avoid easy detection by heuristic rules. EDR telemetry might record that a PowerShell process ran, but without a known bad signature or a clear policy violation, it may not flag it immediately.
The final stage at which the attack should be intercepted by any reputable EDR is at the point of malware execution. But detection evasion is a cat-and-mouse game, and attackers are always looking for ways to tweak their malware to evade or disable detection tools. So, exceptions do happen.
And if you&#x27;re an organization that allows employees and contractors to use unmanaged BYOD devices, there&#x27;s a strong chance that there are gaps in your EDR coverage.
Ultimately, organizations are leaving themselves relying on a single line of defense — if the attack isn&#x27;t detected and blocked by EDR, it isn&#x27;t spotted at all.
Why the standard recommendations are falling short
Most of the vendor-agnostic recommendations have focused on restricting access to services like the Windows Run dialog box for typical users. But although mshta and PowerShell remain the most commonly observed, security researchers have already spotted a wide range of LOLBINS targeting different services, many of which are difficult to prevent users from accessing.
It&#x27;s also worth considering how ClickFix-style attacks may continue to evolve in the future. The current attack path straddles browser and endpoint — what if it could take place entirely in the browser and evade EDR altogether? For example, by pasting malicious JavaScript directly into the devtools on a relevant webpage.
Stopping ClickFix on the front line — in the browser
Push Security&#x27;s latest feature, malicious copy and paste detection , tackles ClickFix-style attacks at the earliest opportunity through browser-based detection and blocking. This is a universally effective control that works regardless of the lure delivery channel, page style and structure, or the specifics of the malware type and execution.
Unlike heavy-handed DLP solutions that block copy-paste altogether, Push protects your employees without disrupting their user experience or hampering productivity.

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a coordinated campaign that leveraged 131 rebranded clones of a WhatsApp Web automation extension for Google Chrome to spam Brazilian users at scale.
The 131 spamware extensions share the same codebase, design patterns, and infrastructure, according to supply chain security company Socket. The browser add-ons collectively have about 20,905 active users.
&quot;They are not classic malware, but they function as high-risk spam automation that abuses platform rules,&quot; security researcher Kirill Boychenko said. &quot;The code injects directly into the WhatsApp Web page, running alongside WhatsApp&#x27;s own scripts, automates bulk outreach and scheduling in ways that aim to bypass WhatsApp&#x27;s anti-spam enforcement.&quot;
The end goal of the campaign is to blast outbound messaging via WhatsApp in a manner that bypasses the messaging platform&#x27;s rate limits and anti-spam controls.
The activity is assessed to have been ongoing for at least nine months, with new uploads and version updates to the extensions observed as recently as October 17, 2025. Some of the identified extensions are listed below -
The extensions have been found to embrace different names and logos, but, behind the scenes, the vast majority of them have been published by &quot;WL Extensão&quot; and its variant &quot;WLExtensao.&quot; It&#x27;s believed that the differences in branding are the result of a franchise model that allows the operation&#x27;s affiliates to flood the Chrome Web Store with various clones of the original extension offered by a company named DBX Tecnologia.
These add-ons also claim to masquerade as customer relationship management (CRM) tools for WhatsApp, allowing users to maximize their sales through the web version of the application.
&quot;Turn your WhatsApp into a powerful sales and contact management tool. With Zap Vende, you&#x27;ll have an intuitive CRM, message automation, bulk messaging, visual sales funnel, and much more,&quot; reads the description of ZapVende on the Chrome Web Store. &quot;Organize your customer service, track leads, and schedule messages in a practical and efficient way.&quot;
DBX Tecnologia, per Socket, advertises a reseller white-label program to allow prospective partners to rebrand and sell its WhatsApp Web extension under their own brand, promising recurring revenue in the range of R$30,000 to R$84,000 by investing R$12,000.
It&#x27;s worth noting that the practice is in violation of Google&#x27;s Chrome Web Store Spam and Abuse policy , which bans developers and their affiliates from submitting multiple extensions that provide duplicate functionality on the platform. DBX Tecnologia has also been found to have put out YouTube videos about bypassing WhatsApp&#x27;s anti-spam algorithms when using the extensions.
&quot;The cluster consists of near-identical copies spread across publisher accounts, is marketed for bulk unsolicited outreach, and automates message sending inside web.whatsapp.com without user confirmation,&quot; Boychenko noted. &quot;The goal is to keep bulk campaigns running while evading anti-spam systems.&quot;
The disclosure comes as Trend Micro, Sophos, and Kaspersky shed light on a large-scale campaign that&#x27;s targeting Brazilian users with a WhatsApp worm dubbed SORVEPOTEL that&#x27;s used to distribute a banking trojan codenamed Maverick.

China on Sunday accused the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) of carrying out a &quot;premeditated&quot; cyber attack targeting the National Time Service Center ( NTSC ), as it described the U.S. as a &quot;hacker empire&quot; and the &quot;greatest source of chaos in cyberspace.&quot;
The Ministry of State Security (MSS), in a WeChat post , said it uncovered &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; of the agency&#x27;s involvement in the intrusion that dated back to March 25, 2022. The attack was ultimately foiled, it added.
Established in 1966 under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), NTSC is responsible for generating, maintaining, and transmitting the national standard of time (Beijing Time).
&quot;Any cyberattack damaging these facilities would jeopardize the secure and stable operation of &#x27;Beijing Time,&#x27; triggering severe consequences such as network communication failures, financial system disruptions, power supply interruptions, transportation paralysis, and space launch failures,&quot; the MSS said.
&quot;This operation thwarted U.S. attempts to steal secrets and conduct sabotage through cyberattacks, fully safeguarding the security of &#x27;Beijing Time.&#x27;&quot;
According to details shared in the WeChat post, the NSA is said to have exploited security flaws in an unnamed foreign brand&#x27;s SMS service to stealthily compromise mobile devices belonging to several staff members at NTSC, resulting in the theft of sensitive data. It did not disclose the nature of the vulnerabilities used to conduct the attack.
On April 18 the following year, the MSS claimed that the agency repeatedly used stolen login credentials to break into the computers at the center to probe its infrastructure, followed by deploying a new &quot;cyber warfare platform&quot; between August 2023 and June 2024.
The platform activated what it described as 42 specialized tools to mount high-intensity attacks aimed at multiple internal network systems of NTSC. The attacks also involved attempts to conduct lateral movement to a high-precision ground-based timing system with the alleged goal of disrupting it.
The attacks, launched between late night and early morning Beijing time, involved the use of virtual private servers (VPSes) based in the U.S., Europe, and Asia to route malicious traffic and conceal its origins.
&quot;They employed tactics such as forging digital certificates to bypass antivirus software and employed high-strength encryption algorithms to thoroughly erase attack traces, leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to carry out cyberattacks and infiltration activities,&quot; the MSS said.
The ministry said China&#x27;s national security agencies neutralized the attack and implemented additional security measures. It also accused the U.S. of launching persistent cyber attacks against China, Southeast Asia, Europe, and South America, adding that it leverages technological footholds in the Philippines, Japan, and China&#x27;s Taiwan Province to launch these activities and obscure its own involvement.
&quot;Simultaneously, the U.S. has resorted to crying wolf, repeatedly hyping the &#x27;China cyber threat theory,&#x27; coercing other countries to amplify so-called &#x27;Chinese hacking incidents,&#x27; sanctioning Chinese enterprises, and prosecuting Chinese citizens – all in a futile attempt to confuse the public and distort the truth,&quot; it alleged.

Europol on Friday announced the disruption of a sophisticated cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) platform that operated a SIM farm and enabled its customers to carry out a broad spectrum of crimes ranging from phishing to investment fraud.
The coordinated law enforcement effort, dubbed Operation SIMCARTEL , saw 26 searches carried out, resulting in the arrest of seven suspects and the seizure of 1,200 SIM box devices , which contained 40,000 active SIM cards. Five of those detained are Latvian nationals.
In addition, five servers were dismantled and two websites (gogetsms[.]com and apisim[.]com) advertising the service was taken over on October 10, 2025, to display a seizure banner. Separately, four luxury vehicles were confiscated, and €431,000 ($502,000) in suspects&#x27; bank accounts and €266,000 ($310,000) in their cryptocurrency accounts were frozen.
The countries that participated in the operation comprised authorities from Austria, Estonia, Finland, and Latvia, in collaboration with Europol and Eurojust.
According to Europol, the criminal network has been attributed to more than 1,700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1,500 in Latvia, leading to losses totaling around €4.5 million ($5.25 million) and €420,000 ($489,000) in the two countries, respectively.
&quot;The criminal network and its infrastructure were technically highly sophisticated and enabled perpetrators around the world to use this SIM-box service to conduct a wide range of telecommunications-related cybercrimes, as well as other crimes,&quot; the agency said.
The infrastructure offered telephone numbers registered to people from over 80 countries for use in criminal activities, including setting up fake accounts on social media and communication platforms with the primary goal of obscuring their original identity and location. In all, the service enabled the creation of more than 49 million online accounts.
These accounts were then used to conduct phishing and smishing attacks and carry out financial fraud by tricking victims into investing their funds in bogus trading schemes. Another involved contacting prospective targets on WhatsApp by posing as their daughter or son, claiming they now have a new number and asking them to transfer money in the four-figure range for an emergency.
Some of the other offenses that were made possible via the platform included extortion, migrant smuggling, and the distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).
According to snapshots captured on the Internet Archive, GoGetSMS was marketed as a way to get &quot;fast and secure temporary phone numbers,&quot; with more than 10 million numbers to choose from and receive verification codes from over 160 online services.
On its website, GoGetSMS also offered the ability to monetize existing SIM cards by turning them into &quot;powerful assets for generating passive income&quot; using its &quot;specialized software,&quot; allowing card owners to earn revenue for every SMS message sent to them.
On review website Trustpilot, paid users have complained of facing issues getting hold of a temporary number through GoGetSMS, with one user claiming that they paid for a U.S. number on the platform and did not get a working number in return. &quot;Tried multiple times, wasted both time and money. Support is completely unresponsive – no help, no refund, nothing,&quot; the user added.
The Latvian State Police, in a coordinated announcement, said the platform was designed for anonymous communication and payments, impacting 3,200 people in various countries.

Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new campaign that has likely targeted the Russian automobile and e-commerce sectors with a previously undocumented .NET malware dubbed CAPI Backdoor .
According to Seqrite Labs , the attack chain involves distributing phishing emails containing a ZIP archive as a way to trigger the infection. The cybersecurity company&#x27;s analysis is based on the ZIP artifact that was uploaded to the VirusTotal platform on October 3, 2025.
Present with the archive is a decoy Russian-language document that purports to be a notification related to income tax legislation and a Windows shortcut (LNK) file.
The LNK file, which has the same name as the ZIP archive (i.e., &quot;Перерасчет заработной платы 01.10.2025&quot;), is responsible for the execution of the .NET implant (&quot;adobe.dll&quot;) using a legitimate Microsoft binary named &quot; rundll32.exe ,&quot; a living-off-the-land (LotL) technique known to be adopted by threat actors.
The backdoor, Seqrite noted, comes with functions to check if it&#x27;s running with administrator-level privileges, gather a list of installed antivirus products, and open the decoy document as a ruse, while it stealthily connects to a remote server (&quot;91.223.75[.]96&quot;) to receive further commands for execution.
The commands allow CAPI Backdoor to steal data from web browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox; take screenshots; collect system information; enumerate folder contents; and exfiltrate the results back to the server.
It also attempts to run a long list of checks to determine if it&#x27;s a legitimate host or a virtual machine, and makes use of two methods to establish persistence, including setting up a scheduled task and creating a LNK file in the Windows Startup folder to automatically launch the backdoor DLL copied to the Windows Roaming folder.
Seqrite&#x27;s assessment that the threat actor is targeting the Russian automobile sector is down to the fact that one of the domains linked to the campaign is named carprlce[.]ru, which appears to impersonate the legitimate &quot;carprice[.]ru.&quot;
&quot;The malicious payload is a .NET DLL that functions as a stealer and establishes persistence for future malicious activities,&quot; researchers Priya Patel and Subhajeet Singha said.

"><div class="cell-inner"><div class="cell-content">New .NET CAPI Backdoor Targets Russian Auto and E-Commerce Firms via Phishing ZIPs
Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new campaign that has likely targeted the Russian automobile and e-commerce sectors with a previously undocumented .NET malware dubbed CAPI Backdoor .
According to Seqrite Labs , the attack chain involves distributing phishing emails containing a ZIP archive as a way to trigger the infection. The cybersecurity company&#x27;s analysis is based on the ZIP artifact that was uploaded to the VirusTotal platform on October 3, 2025.
Present with the archive is a decoy Russian-language document that purports to be a notification related to income tax legislation and a Windows shortcut (LNK) file.
The LNK file, which has the same name as the ZIP archive (i.e., &quot;Перерасчет заработной платы 01.10.2025&quot;), is responsible for the execution of the .NET implant (&quot;adobe.dll&quot;) using a legitimate Microsoft binary named &quot; rundll32.exe ,&quot; a living-off-the-land (LotL) technique known to be adopted by threat actors.
The backdoor, Seqrite noted, comes with functions to check if it&#x27;s running with administrator-level privileges, gather a list of installed antivirus products, and open the decoy document as a ruse, while it stealthily connects to a remote server (&quot;91.223.75[.]96&quot;) to receive further commands for execution.
The commands allow CAPI Backdoor to steal data from web browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox; take screenshots; collect system information; enumerate folder contents; and exfiltrate the results back to the server.
It also attempts to run a long list of checks to determine if it&#x27;s a legitimate host or a virtual machine, and makes use of two methods to establish persistence, including setting up a scheduled task and creating a LNK file in the Windows Startup folder to automatically launch the backdoor DLL copied to the Windows Roaming folder.

The threat actors behind a malware family known as Winos 4.0 (aka ValleyRAT) have expanded their targeting footprint from China and Taiwan to target Japan and Malaysia with another remote access trojan (RAT) tracked as HoldingHands RAT (aka Gh0stBins).
&quot;The campaign relied on phishing emails with PDFs that contained embedded malicious links,&quot; Pei Han Liao, researcher with Fortinet&#x27;s FortiGuard Labs, said in a report shared with The Hacker News. &quot;These files masqueraded as official documents from the Ministry of Finance and included numerous links in addition to the one that delivered Winos 4.0.&quot;
Winos 4.0 is a malware family that&#x27;s often spread via phishing and search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning, directing unsuspecting users to fake websites masquerading as popular software like Google Chrome, Telegram, Youdao, Sogou AI, WPS Office, and DeepSeek, among others.
The use of Winos 4.0 is primarily linked to an &quot;aggressive&quot; Chinese cybercrime group known as Silver Fox, which is also tracked as SwimSnake, The Great Thief of Valley (or Valley Thief), UTG-Q-1000, and Void Arachne.
Last month, Check Point attributed the threat actor to the abuse of a previously unknown vulnerable driver associated with WatchDog Anti-malware as part of a Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attack aimed at disabling security software installed on compromised hosts.
Then weeks later, Fortinet shed light on another campaign that took place in August 2025, leveraging SEO poisoning to distribute HiddenGh0st and modules associated with the Winos malware.
Silver Fox&#x27;s targeting of Taiwan and Japan with HoldingHands RAT was also documented by the cybersecurity company and a security researcher named somedieyoungZZ back in June, with the attackers employing phishing emails containing booby-trapped PDF documents to activate a multi-stage infection that ultimately deploys the trojan.
It&#x27;s worth noting at this stage that both Winos 4.0 and HoldingHands RAT are inspired by another RAT malware referred to as Gh0st RAT , which had its source code leaked in 2008 and has since been widely adopted by various Chinese hacking groups.
Fortinet said it identified PDF documents posing as a tax regulation draft for Taiwan that included a URL to a Japanese language web page (&quot;twsww[.]xin/download[.]html&quot;), from where victims are prompted to download a ZIP archive responsible for delivering HoldingHands RAT.
Further investigation has uncovered attacks targeting China that have utilized taxation-themed Microsoft Excel documents as lures, some dating back to March 2024, to distribute Winos. Recent phishing campaigns, however, have shifted their focus to Malaysia, using fake landing pages to deceive recipients into downloading HoldingHands RAT.
The starting point is an executable claiming to be an excise audit document. It&#x27;s used to sideload a malicious DLL, which functions as a shellcode loader for &quot;sw.dat,&quot; a payload that&#x27;s designed to run anti-virtual machine (VM) checks, enumerate active processes against a list of security products from Avast, Norton, and Kaspersky, and terminate them if found, escalate privileges, and terminate the Task Scheduler.
It also drops several other files in the system&#x27;s C:\Windows\System32 folder -
&quot;The Task Scheduler is a Windows service hosted by svchost.exe that allows users to control when specific operations or processes are run,&quot; Fortinet said. &quot;The Task Scheduler&#x27;s recovery setting is configured to restart the service one minute after it fails by default.&quot;
&quot;When the Task Scheduler is restarted, svchost.exe is executed and loads the malicious TimeBrokerClient.dll. This trigger mechanism does not require the direct launch of any process, making behavior-based detection more challenging.&quot;
For privilege escalation, &quot;sw.dat&quot; impersonates the TrustedInstaller account to execute code. TrustedInstaller is a high-level Windows system account that&#x27;s designed to protect core system files, such as those present in the C: drive, from being modified, even by administrators. It&#x27;s part of a broader security feature called Windows Resource Protection ( WRP ) that&#x27;s designed to prevent accidental changes to files, folders, and registry keys installed as part of the operating system.
&quot;To achieve this, the malware first enables the SeDebugPrivilege privilege to gain access to the Winlogon process and its security token,&quot; Fortinet threat security researcher Rachael Pei told The Hacker News. &quot;With that access it obtains and adopts the Winlogon token to run as the Winlogon account (SYSTEM).&quot;
&quot;From that elevated context the malware then proceeds to acquire a TrustedInstaller security context. TrustedInstaller is a built-in Windows system account. Certain files, registry keys, etc, can only be accessed with the account. An example is C:\Windows\System32\TimeBrokerClient.dll for the Task Scheduler-based execution. The malware needs to rename the legitimate TimeBrokerClient.dll as BrokerClientCallback.dll and this needs TrustedInstaller permission.&quot;
The primary function of &quot;TimeBrokerClient.dll&quot; is to allocate memory for the encrypted shellcode within &quot;msvchost.dat&quot; by invoking the VirtualAlloc() function using the RVA value specified in &quot;svchost.ini.&quot; In the next stage, &quot;msvchost.dat&quot; decrypts the payload stored in &quot;system.dat&quot; to retrieve the HoldingHands payload.
HoldingHands is equipped to connect to a remote server, send host information to it, send a heartbeat signal every 60 seconds to maintain the connection, and receive and process attacker-issued commands on the infected system. These commands allow the malware to capture sensitive information, run arbitrary commands, and download additional payloads.
A new feature addition is a command that makes it possible to update the command-and-control (C2) address used for communications via a Windows Registry entry.
Pei also pointed out that Chinese speakers appear to be a primary focus of the latest campaign, adding &quot;the most likely motivation appears to be regional intelligence collection, with the malware lying dormant as it awaits further commands.&quot;
Operation Silk Lure Targets China with ValleyRAT
The development comes as Seqrite Labs detailed an ongoing email-based phishing campaign that has leveraged C2 infrastructure hosted in the U.S., targeting Chinese companies in the fintech, cryptocurrency, and trading platform sectors to ultimately deliver Winos 4.0. The campaign has been codenamed Operation Silk Lure, owing to its China-related footprint.
&quot;The adversaries craft highly targeted emails impersonating job seekers and send them to HR departments and technical hiring teams within Chinese firms,&quot; researchers Dixit Panchal, Soumen Burma, and Kartik Jivani said .
&quot;These emails often contain malicious .LNK (Windows shortcut) files embedded within seemingly legitimate résumés or portfolio documents. When executed, these .LNK files act as droppers, initiating the execution of payloads that facilitate initial compromise.&quot;
The LNK file, when launched, runs PowerShell code to download a decoy PDF resume, while stealthily dropping three additional payloads to the &quot;C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Security&quot; location and executing it. The PDF resumes are localized and tailored for Chinese targets so as to increase the likelihood of success of the social engineering attack.
The payloads dropped are as follows -
&quot;The deployed malware establishes persistence within the compromised system and initiates various reconnaissance operations,&quot; the researchers said. &quot;These include capturing screenshots, harvesting clipboard contents, and exfiltrating critical system metadata.&quot;
The trojan also comes with various techniques to evade detection, including attempting to uninstall detected antivirus products and terminating network connections associated with security programs such as Kingsoft Antivirus, Huorong, or 360 Total Security to interfere with their regular functions.
&quot;This exfiltrated information significantly elevates the risk of advanced cyber espionage, identity theft, and credential compromise, thereby posing a serious threat to both organizational infrastructure and individual privacy,&quot; the researchers added.

OtterCookie into Advanced JS Malware
The North Korean threat actor linked to the Contagious Interview campaign has been observed merging some of the functionality of two of its malware programs, indicating that the hacking group is actively refining its toolset.
That&#x27;s according to new findings from Cisco Talos, which said recent campaigns undertaken by the hacking group have seen the functions of BeaverTail and OtterCookie coming closer to each other more than ever, even as the latter has been fitted with a new module for keylogging and taking screenshots.
The activity is attributed to a threat cluster that&#x27;s tracked by the cybersecurity community under the monikers CL-STA-0240, DeceptiveDevelopment, DEV#POPPER, Famous Chollima, Gwisin Gang, PurpleBravo, Tenacious Pungsan, UNC5342, Void Dokkaebi, and WaterPlum.
The development comes as Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant revealed the threat actor&#x27;s use of a stealthy technique known as EtherHiding to fetch next-stage payloads from the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) or Ethereum blockchains, essentially turning decentralized infrastructure into a resilient command-and-control (C2) server. It represents the first documented case of a nation-state actor utilizing the method that has been otherwise adopted by cybercrime groups.
Contagious Interview refers to an elaborate recruitment scam that began sometime around late 2022, with the North Korean threat actors impersonating hiring organizations to target job seekers and deceiving them into installing information-stealing malware as part of a supposed technical assessment or coding task, resulting in the theft of sensitive data and cryptocurrency.
In recent months, the campaign has undergone several shifts, including leveraging ClickFix social engineering techniques for delivering malware strains such as GolangGhost, PylangGhost, TsunamiKit, Tropidoor, and AkdoorTea. Central to the attacks, however, are malware families known as BeaverTail, OtterCookie, and InvisibleFerret.
BeaverTail and OtterCookie are separate but complementary malware tools, with the latter first spotted in real-world attacks in September 2024. Unlike BeaverTail, which functions as an information stealer and downloader, initial interactions of OtterCookie were designed to contact a remote server and fetch commands to be executed on the compromised host.
The activity detected by Cisco Talos concerns an organization headquartered in Sri Lanka. It&#x27;s assessed that the company was not intentionally targeted by the threat actors, but rather they had one of their systems infected, likely after a user fell victim to a fake job offer that instructed them to install a trojanized Node.js application called Chessfi hosted on Bitbucket as part of the interview process.
Interestingly, the malicious software includes a dependency via a package called &quot;node-nvm-ssh&quot; published to the official npm repository on August 20, 2025, by a user named &quot;trailer.&quot; The package attracted a total of 306 downloads , before it was taken down by the npm maintainers six days later.
It&#x27;s also worth noting that the npm package in question is one of the 338 malicious Node.js libraries flagged earlier this week by software supply chain security company Socket as connected to the Contagious Interview campaign.
The package, once installed, triggers the malicious behavior by means of a postinstall hook in its package.json file that&#x27;s configured to run a custom script called &quot;skip&quot; so as to launch a JavaScript payload (&quot;index.js&quot;), which, in turn, loads another JavaScript (&quot;file15.js&quot;) responsible for executing the final-stage malware.
Further analysis of the tool used in the attack has found that &quot;it had characteristics of BeaverTail and of OtterCookie, blurring the distinction between the two,&quot; security researchers Vanja Svajcer and Michael Kelley said, adding it incorporated a new keylogging and screenshotting module that uses legitimate npm packages like &quot; node-global-key-listener &quot; and &quot; screenshot-desktop &quot; to capture keystrokes and take screenshots, respectively, and exfiltrate the information to the C2 server.
At least one version of this new module comes equipped with an auxiliary clipboard monitoring feature to siphon clipboard content. The emergence of the new version of OtterCookie paints a picture of a tool that has evolved from basic data-gathering to a modular program for data theft and remote command execution.
Also present in the malware, codenamed OtterCookie v5, are functions akin to BeaverTail to enumerate browser profiles and extensions, steal data from web browsers and cryptocurrency wallets, install AnyDesk for persistent remote access, as well as download a Python backdoor referred to as InvisibleFerret.
Some of the other modules present in OtterCookie are listed below -
Furthermore, Talos said it detected a Qt-based BeaverTail artifact and a malicious Visual Studio Code extension containing BeaverTail and OtterCookie code, raising the possibility that the group may be experimenting with new methods of malware delivery.
&quot;The extension could also be a result of experimentation from another actor, possibly even a researcher, who is not associated with Famous Chollima, as this stands out from their usual TTPs,&quot; the researchers noted.
Contagious Interview Evolves with New OtterCandy Malware
The disclosure comes as NTT Security Holdings shared details of a new malware called OtterCandy, deployed in connection with the Contagious Interview campaign since July 2025, targeting Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. An early sample of OtterCandy was uploaded to the VirusTotal platform in February 2025.
OtterCandy, per the Japanese cybersecurity company, combines the features of OtterCookie and RATatouille, a remote access trojan (RAT) distributed via the supply chain compromise of the npm package &quot; rand-user-agent &quot; back in May 2025. This is the first time the attack has been attributed to North Korean threat actors.
The obfuscated payload embedded within the npm package is designed to set up a stealthy communication channel with a remote server and exfiltrate files within a particular directory and execute shell commands, the latter of which is specific only to Windows, according to Aikido.
The full list of supported commands is below -
OtterCandy is said to be distributed via a sub-cluster of activity tracked as ClickFake Interview (aka Cluster B), which involves deceiving users with ClickFix-style lures to run malicious commands so as to fix supposed camera or microphone issues when job seekers attempt to provide a video assessment on a fake website under their control.
&quot;OtterCandy is a RAT and Info Stealer implemented by Node.js,&quot; NTT Security said. &quot;It is malware that combines elements of RATatouille and OtterCookie. OtterCandy accepts commands when connected to the C2 server via Socket.IO.&quot;
The first-stage malware used to deliver OtterCandy is named DiggingBeaver, a JavaScript payload that&#x27;s executed once the victim copies and runs the command via the Windows Run dialog. DiggingBeaver has also been found to distribute other known ClickFake Interview malware, such as GolangGhost and FROSTYFERRET .
NTT Security said it also observed a new variant of OtterCandy (OtterCandy v2) in August 2025 that comes with expanded functionality to harvest data from three additional cryptocurrency wallet extensions (Suiet, Trust Wallet, and Rabby Wallet), as well as enhance the &quot;ss_del&quot; command to delete Windows Registry keys and erase files and directories.
(The story was updated after publication on October 19, 2025, to include details of OtterCandy malware from NTT Security Holdings.)

The danger isn&#x27;t that AI agents have bad days — it&#x27;s that they never do. They execute faithfully, even when what they&#x27;re executing is a mistake. A single misstep in logic or access can turn flawless automation into a flawless catastrophe.
This isn&#x27;t some dystopian fantasy—it&#x27;s Tuesday at the office now. We&#x27;ve entered a new phase where autonomous AI agents act with serious system privileges. They execute code, handle complex tasks, and access sensitive data with unprecedented autonomy. They don&#x27;t sleep, don&#x27;t ask questions, and don&#x27;t always wait for permission.
That&#x27;s powerful. That&#x27;s also risky. Because today&#x27;s enterprise threats go way beyond your garden-variety phishing scams and malware. The modern security perimeter? It&#x27;s all about identity management. Here&#x27;s the million-dollar question every CISO should be asking: Who or what has access to your critical systems, can you secure and govern that access, and can you actually prove it?
How identity became the new security perimeter
Remember those old-school security models built around firewalls and endpoint protection? They served their purpose once — but they weren&#x27;t designed for the distributed, identity-driven threats we face today. Identity has become the central control point, weaving complex connections between users, systems, and data repositories. The 2025-2026 SailPoint Horizons of Identity Security report shows that identity management has evolved from a back-office control to mission-critical for the modern enterprise.
The explosion of AI agents, automated systems, and non-human identities has dramatically expanded our attack surfaces. These entities are now prime attack vectors. Here&#x27;s a sobering reality check: Fewer than 4 in 10 AI agents are governed by identity security policies, leaving a significant gap in enterprise security frameworks. Organizations without comprehensive identity visibility? They&#x27;re not just vulnerable—they&#x27;re sitting ducks.
The strategic goldmine of mature identity security
But here&#x27;s where it gets interesting. Despite these mounting challenges, there&#x27;s a massive opportunity for organizations that get identity security right. The Horizons of Identity Security report reveals something fascinating: Organizations consistently achieve their highest ROI from identity security programs compared to every other security domain. They rank Identity and Access Management as their top-ROI security investment at twice the rate of other security categories.
Why? Because mature identity security pulls double duty—it prevents breaches while driving operational efficiency and enabling new business capabilities. Organizations with mature identity programs, especially those using AI-driven capabilities and real-time identity data sync, show dramatically better cost savings and risk reduction. Mature organizations are four times more likely to have AI-enabled capabilities like Identity Threat Detection and Response.
The great identity divide
Here&#x27;s where things get concerning: There&#x27;s a growing chasm between organizations with mature identity programs and those still playing catch-up. The Horizons of Identity Security report shows that 63% of organizations are stuck in early-stage identity security maturity (Horizons 1 or 2). These organizations aren&#x27;t just missing out—they are facing more risk against modern threats.
This gap keeps widening because the bar keeps rising. The 2025 framework added seven new capability requirements to address emerging threat vectors. Organizations that aren&#x27;t advancing their identity capabilities aren&#x27;t just standing still—they&#x27;re effectively moving backward. Organizations experiencing capability regression show significantly lower adoption rates for AI agent identity management.
This challenge goes beyond just technology. Only 25% of organizations position IAM as a strategic business enabler—the rest see it as just another security checkbox or compliance requirement. This narrow view severely limits transformative potential and keeps organizations vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.
Time for a reality check
The threat landscape is evolving at breakneck speed, with unprecedented risk levels across all sectors. Identity security has evolved from just another security component into the core of enterprise security. Organizations need to honestly assess their readiness for managing extensive AI agent deployments and automated system access.
A proactive assessment of your current identity security posture provides critical insight into organizational readiness and competitive positioning.

This challenge goes beyond just technology. Only 25% of organizations position IAM as a strategic business enabler—the rest see it as just another security checkbox or compliance requirement. This narrow view severely limits transformative potential and keeps organizations vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.
Time for a reality check
The threat landscape is evolving at breakneck speed, with unprecedented risk levels across all sectors. Identity security has evolved from just another security component into the core of enterprise security. Organizations need to honestly assess their readiness for managing extensive AI agent deployments and automated system access.
A proactive assessment of your current identity security posture provides critical insight into organizational readiness and competitive positioning.

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a recently patched critical security flaw in WatchGuard Fireware that could allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code.
The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-9242 (CVSS score: 9.3), is described as an out-of-bounds write vulnerability affecting Fireware OS 11.10.2 up to and including 11.12.4_Update1, 12.0 up to and including 12.11.3 and 2025.1.
&quot;An out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the WatchGuard Fireware OS iked process may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code,&quot; WatchGuard said in an advisory released last month. &quot;This vulnerability affects both the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 and the branch office VPN using IKEv2 when configured with a dynamic gateway peer.&quot;
It has been addressed in the following versions -
A new analysis from watchTowr Labs has described CVE-2025-9242 as having &quot;all the characteristics your friendly neighbourhood ransomware gangs love to see,&quot; including the fact that it affects an internet-exposed service, is exploitable sans authentication, and can execute arbitrary code on a perimeter appliance.
The vulnerability, per security researcher McCaulay Hudson, is rooted in the function &quot;ike2_ProcessPayload_CERT&quot; present in the file &quot;src/ike/iked/v2/ike2_payload_cert.c&quot; that&#x27;s designed to copy a client &quot;identification&quot; to a local stack buffer of 520 bytes, and then validate the provided client SSL certificate.
The issue arises as a result of a missing length check on the identification buffer, thereby allowing an attacker to trigger an overflow and achieve remote code execution during the IKE_SA_AUTH phase of the handshake process used to establish a virtual private network (VPN) tunnel between a client and WatchGuard&#x27;s VPN service via the IKE key management protocol.
&quot;The server does attempt certificate validation, but that validation happens after the vulnerable code runs, allowing our vulnerable code path to be reachable pre-authentication,&quot; Hudson said .
WatchTowr noted that while WatchGuard Fireware OS lacks an interactive shell such as &quot;/bin/bash,&quot; it&#x27;s possible to for an attacker to weaponize the flaw and gain control of the instruction pointer register (aka RIP or program counter) to ultimately spawn a Python interactive shell over TCP by leveraging an mprotect() system call , effectively bypassing NX bit (aka no-execute bit) mitigations.
Once the remote Python shell is launched, the foothold can be escalated further through a multi-step process to obtain a full Linux shell -
The development comes as watchTowr demonstrated that a now-fixed denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability impacting Progress Telerik UI for AJAX ( CVE-2025-3600 , CVSS score: 7.5) can also enable remote code execution depending on the targeted environment. The vulnerability was addressed by Progress Software on April 30, 2025.
&quot;Depending on the target codebase – for example, the presence of particular no-argument constructors, finalizers, or insecure assembly resolvers – the impact can escalate to remote code execution,&quot; security researcher Piotr Bazydlo said .
Earlier this month, watchTowr&#x27;s Sina Kheirkhah also shed light on a critical pre-authenticated command injection flaw in Dell UnityVSA ( CVE-2025-36604 , CVSS score: 9.8/7.3) that could result in remote command execution. Dell remediated the vulnerability in July 2025 following responsible disclosure on March 28.
Update
The Shadowserver Foundation has revealed that there are an estimated 73,000 WatchGuard instances that are susceptible to CVE-2025-9242 as October 20, 2025, with the U.S. accounting for about 24,000 of them, followed by Germany (7,045), Italy (6,542), the U.K. (5,333), and Canada (3,866).

Microsoft on Thursday disclosed that it revoked more than 200 certificates used by a threat actor it tracks as Vanilla Tempest to fraudulently sign malicious binaries in ransomware attacks.
The certificates were &quot;used in fake Teams setup files to deliver the Oyster backdoor and ultimately deploy Rhysida ransomware,&quot; the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team said in a post shared on X.
The tech giant said it disrupted the activity earlier this month after it was detected in late September 2025. In addition to revoking the certificates, its security solutions have been updated to flag the signatures associated with the fake setup files, Oyster backdoor, and Rhysida ransomware.
Vanilla Tempest (formerly Storm-0832) is the name given to a financially motivated threat actor also called Vice Society and Vice Spider that&#x27;s assessed to be active since at least July 2022, delivering various ransomware strains such as BlackCat, Quantum Locker, Zeppelin, and Rhysida over the years.
Oyster (aka Broomstick and CleanUpLoader), on the other hand, is a backdoor that&#x27;s often distributed via trojanized installers for popular software such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Teams using bogus websites that users stumble upon when searching for the programs on Google and Bing.
&quot;In this campaign, Vanilla Tempest used fake MSTeamsSetup.exe files hosted on malicious domains mimicking Microsoft Teams, for example, teams-download[.]buzz, teams-install[.]run, or teams-download[.]top,&quot; Microsoft said. &quot;Users are likely directed to malicious download sites using search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning.&quot;
To sign these installers and other post-compromise tools, the threat actor is said to have used Trusted Signing , as well as SSL[.]com, DigiCert, and GlobalSign code signing services.
Details of the campaign were first disclosed by Blackpoint Cyber last month, highlighting how users searching for Teams online were redirected to bogus download pages, where they were offered a malicious MSTeamsSetup.exe instead of the legitimate client.
&quot;This activity highlights the continued abuse of SEO poisoning and malicious advertisements to deliver commodity backdoors under the guise of trusted software,&quot; the company said. &quot;Threat actors are exploiting user trust in search results and well-known brands to gain initial access.&quot;
To mitigate such risks, it&#x27;s advised to download software only from verified sources and avoid clicking on suspicious links served via search engine ads.

A threat actor with ties to the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (aka North Korea) has been observed leveraging the EtherHiding technique to distribute malware and enable cryptocurrency theft, marking the first time a state-sponsored hacking group has embraced the method.
The activity has been attributed by Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) to a threat cluster it tracks as UNC5342 , which is also known as CL-STA-0240 (Palo Alto Networks Unit 42), DeceptiveDevelopment (ESET), DEV#POPPER (Securonix), Famous Chollima (CrowdStrike), Gwisin Gang (DTEX), Tenacious Pungsan (Datadog), and Void Dokkaebi (Trend Micro).
The attack wave is part of a long-running campaign codenamed Contagious Interview , wherein the attackers approach potential targets on LinkedIn by posing as recruiters or hiring managers, and trick them into running malicious code under the pretext of a job assessment after shifting the conversation to Telegram or Discord.
The end goal of these efforts is to gain unauthorized access to developers&#x27; machines, steal sensitive data, and siphon cryptocurrency assets – consistent with North Korea&#x27;s twin pursuit of cyber espionage and financial gain.
Google said it has observed UNC5342 incorporating EtherHiding – a stealthy approach that involves embedding nefarious code within a smart contract on a public blockchain like BNB Smart Chain (BSC) or Ethereum – since February 2025. In doing so, the attack turns the blockchain into a decentralized dead drop resolver that&#x27;s resilient to takedown efforts.
Besides resilience, EtherHiding also abuses the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions to make it harder to trace who has deployed the smart contract. Complicating matters further, the technique is also flexible in that it allows the attacker who is in control of the smart contract to update the malicious payload at any time (albeit costing an average of $1.37 in gas fees), thereby opening the door to a wide spectrum of threats.
&quot;This development signals an escalation in the threat landscape, as nation-state threat actors are now utilizing new techniques to distribute malware that is resistant to law enforcement take-downs and can be easily modified for new campaigns,&quot; Robert Wallace, consulting leader at Mandiant, Google Cloud, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.
The infection chain triggered following the social engineering attack is a multi-stage process that&#x27;s capable of targeting Windows, macOS, and Linux systems with three different malware families -
In a nutshell, the attack coaxes the victim to run code that executes the initial JavaScript downloader that interacts with a malicious BSC smart contract to download JADESNOW, which subsequently queries the transaction history associated with an Ethereum address to fetch the third-stage payload, in this case the JavaScript version of InvisibleFerret.
The malware also attempts to install a portable Python interpreter to execute an additional credential stealer component stored at a different Ethereum address. The findings are significant because of the threat actor&#x27;s use of multiple blockchains for EtherHiding activity.
Wallace told The Hacker News that they have not observed DPRK actors distribute fake installers (such as those for video conferencing software like FreeConference as has happened in the past) in conjunction with utilizing smart contracts as a stager for malicious code.
&quot;EtherHiding represents a shift toward next-generation bulletproof hosting, where the inherent features of blockchain technology are repurposed for malicious ends,&quot; Google said. &quot;This technique underscores the continuous evolution of cyber threats as attackers adapt and leverage new technologies to their advantage.&quot;

A financially motivated threat actor codenamed UNC5142 has been observed abusing blockchain smart contracts as a way to facilitate the distribution of information stealers, such as Atomic (AMOS), Lumma, Rhadamanthys (aka RADTHIEF), and Vidar, targeting both Windows and Apple macOS systems.
&quot;UNC5142 is characterized by its use of compromised WordPress websites and &#x27;EtherHiding,&#x27; a technique used to obscure malicious code or data by placing it on a public blockchain, such as the BNB Smart Chain,&quot; Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) said in a report shared with The Hacker News.
As of June 2025, Google said it flagged about 14,000 web pages containing injected JavaScript that exhibit behavior associated with an UNC5142, indicating indiscriminate targeting of vulnerable WordPress sites. However, the tech giant noted that it has not spotted any UNC5142 activity since July 23, 2025, either signaling a pause or an operational pivot.
EtherHiding was first documented by Guardio Labs in October 2023, when it detailed attacks that involved serving malicious code by utilizing Binance&#x27;s Smart Chain (BSC) contracts via infected sites serving fake browser update warnings.
A crucial aspect that underpins the attack chains is a multi-stage JavaScript downloader dubbed CLEARSHORT that enables the distribution of the malware via the hacked sites. The first stage is a JavaScript malware that&#x27;s inserted into the websites to retrieve the second-stage by interacting with a malicious smart contract stored on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain. The first stage malware is added to plugin-related files, theme files, and, in some cases, even directly into the WordPress database.
The smart contract, for its part, is responsible for fetching a CLEARSHORT landing page from an external server that, in turn, employs the ClickFix social engineering tactic to deceive victims into running malicious commands on the Windows Run dialog (or the Terminal app on Macs), ultimately infecting the system with stealer malware. The landing pages, typically hosted on a Cloudflare .dev page, are retrieved in an encrypted format as of December 2024.
On Windows systems, the malicious command entails the execution of an HTML Application (HTA) file downloaded from a MediaFire URL, which then drops a PowerShell script to sidestep defenses, fetch the encrypted final payload from either GitHub or MediaFire, or their own infrastructure in some cases, and run the stealer directly in memory without writing the artifact to disk.
In attacks targeting macOS in February and April 2025, the attackers have been found to utilize ClickFix decoys to prompt the user to run a bash command on Terminal that retrieved a shell script. The script subsequently uses the curl command to obtain the Atomic Stealer payload from the remote server.
CLEARSHORT is assessed to be a variant of ClearFake , which was the subject of an extensive analysis by French cybersecurity company Sekoia in March 2025. ClearFake is a rogue JavaScript framework deployed on compromised websites to deliver malware through the drive-by download technique. It&#x27;s known to be active since July 2023, with the attacks adopting ClickFix around May 2024.
The abuse of blockchain offers several advantages, as the clever technique not only blends in with legitimate Web3 activity, but also increases the resiliency of UNC5142&#x27;s operations against detection and takedown efforts.
Google said the threat actor&#x27;s campaigns have witnessed considerable evolution over the past year, shifting from a single-contract system to a more sophisticated three-smart contract system beginning in November 2024 for better operational agility, with further refinements observed earlier this January.
&quot;This new architecture is an adaptation of a legitimate software design principle known as the proxy pattern, which developers use to make their contracts upgradable,&quot; it explained.
&quot;The setup functions as a highly efficient Router-Logic-Storage architecture where each contract has a specific job. This design allows for rapid updates to critical parts of the attack, such as the landing page URL or decryption key, without any need to modify the JavaScript on compromised websites. As a result, the campaigns are much more agile and resistant to takedowns.&quot;
UNC5142&#x27;s accomplishes this by taking advantage of the mutable nature of a smart contract&#x27;s data (it&#x27;s worth noting that the program code is immutable once it&#x27;s deployed) to alter the payload URL, costing them anywhere between $0.25 and $1.50 in network fees to perform these updates.
Further analysis has determined the threat actor&#x27;s use of two distinct sets of smart contract infrastructures to deliver stealer malware via the CLEARSHORT downloader. The Main infrastructure is said to have been created on November 24, 2024, whereas the parallel Secondary infrastructure was funded on February 18, 2025.
&quot;The Main infrastructure stands out as the core campaign infrastructure, marked by its early creation and steady stream of updates,&quot; GTIG said. &quot;The Secondary infrastructure appears as a parallel, more tactical deployment, likely established to support a specific surge in campaign activity, test new lures, or simply build operational resilience.&quot;
&quot;Given the frequent updates to the infection chain coupled with the consistent operational tempo, high volume of compromised websites, and diversity of distributed malware payloads over the past year and a half, it is likely that UNC5142 has experienced some level of success with their operations.&quot;

An investigation into the compromise of an Amazon Web Services (AWS)-hosted infrastructure has led to the discovery of a new GNU/Linux rootkit dubbed LinkPro , according to findings from Synacktiv.
&quot;This backdoor features functionalities relying on the installation of two eBPF [extended Berkeley Packet Filter] modules, on the one hand to conceal itself, and on the other hand to be remotely activated upon receiving a &#x27;magic packet,&#x27;&quot; security researcher Théo Letailleur said .
The infection, per the French cybersecurity company, involved the attackers exploiting an exposed Jenkins server vulnerable to CVE-2024-23897 (CVSS score: 9.8) as the starting point, following which a malicious Docker Hub image named &quot;kvlnt/vv&quot; (now removed) was deployed on several Kubernetes clusters.
The Docker image consists of a Kali Linux base along with a folder called &quot;app&quot; containing three files -
Also delivered to the Kubernetes nodes were two other malware strains, a dropper embedding another vShell backdoor, and LinkPro, a rootkit written in Golang. The stealthy malware can operate in either passive (aka reverse) or active (aka forward) mode, depending on its configuration, allowing it to listen for commands from the C2 server only upon receiving a specific TCP packet or directly initiate contact with the server.
While the forward mode supports five different communication protocols, including HTTP, WebSocket, UDP, TCP, and DNS, the reverse mode only uses the HTTP protocol. The overall sequence of events unfolds as follows -
To achieve this, LinkPro modifies the &quot;/etc/ld.so.preload&quot; configuration file to specify the path of the libld.so shared library embedded within it with the main objective of concealing various artifacts that could reveal the backdoor&#x27;s presence.
&quot;Thanks to the presence of the /etc/libld.so path in /etc/ld.so.preload, the libld.so shared library installed by LinkPro is loaded by all programs that require /lib/ld-linux.so14,&quot; Letailleur explained. &quot;This includes all programs that use shared libraries, such as glibc.&quot;
&quot;Once libld.so is loaded at the execution of a program, for example /usr/bin/ls, it hooks (before glibc) several libc functions to modify results that could reveal the presence of LinkPro.&quot;
The magic packet, per Synacktiv, is a TCP packet with a window size value of 54321. Once this packet is detected, the Knock module saves the source IP address of the packet and an associated expiration date of one hour as its value. The program then keeps an eye out for additional TCP packets whose source IP address matches that of the already saved IP.
In other words, the core functionality of LinkPro is to wait for a magic packet to be sent, after which the threat actor has a one-hour window to send commands to a port of their choice. The Knock module is also designed to modify the incoming TCP packet&#x27;s header to replace the original destination port with LinkPro&#x27;s listening port (2333), and alter the outgoing packet to replace the source port (2233) with the original port.
&quot;The purpose of this maneuver is to allow the operator to activate command reception for LinkPro by going through any port authorized by the front-end firewall,&quot; Synacktiv said. &quot;This also makes the correlation between the front-end firewall logs and the network activity of the compromised host more complex.&quot;
The commands supported by LinkPro include executing /bin/bash in a pseudo-terminal, running a shell command, enumerating files and directories, performing file operations, downloading files, and setting up a SOCKS5 proxy tunnel. It&#x27;s currently not known who is behind the attack, but it&#x27;s suspected that the threat actors are financially motivated.
&quot;For its concealment at the kernel level, the rootkit uses eBPF programs of the tracepoint and kretprobe types to intercept the getdents (file hiding) and sys_bpf (hiding its own BPF programs) system calls. Notably, this technique requires a specific kernel configuration (CONFIG_BPF_KPROBE_OVERRIDE),&quot; the company said.
&quot;If the latter is not present, LinkPro falls back on an alternative method by loading a malicious library via the /etc/ld.so.preload file to ensure the concealment of its activities in user space.&quot;

Scaling the SOC with AI - Why now?
Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are under unprecedented pressure. According to SACR&#x27;s AI-SOC Market Landscape 2025 , the average organization now faces around 960 alerts per day , while large enterprises manage more than 3,000 alerts daily from an average of 28 different tools . Nearly 40% of those alerts go uninvestigated , and 61% of security teams admit to overlooking alerts that later proved critical.
The takeaway is clear: the traditional SOC model can&#x27;t keep up.
AI has now moved from experimentation to execution inside the SOC. 88% of organizations that don&#x27;t yet run an AI-driven SOC plan to evaluate or deploy one within the next year.
But as more vendors promote &quot;AI-powered SOC automation,&quot; the challenge for security leaders has shifted from awareness to evaluation. The key question is no longer whether AI belongs in the SOC, but how to measure its real impact and select a platform that delivers value without introducing significant risks.
This article provides a practical framework for doing just that. It explores AI-SOC architectures, implementation models, and risks, while outlining phased adoption strategies and the essential questions every organization should ask before choosing a platform.
The Mindset Shift: From Legacy to a Modern SOC
Building an AI-augmented SOC starts with a mindset shift, not a technology purchase.
Legacy SOCs depend on static rules, manual triage, and reactive workflows. Analysts spend hours chasing alerts and fine-tuning detections to manage noise — a model that doesn&#x27;t scale and fuels alert fatigue.
Modern SOCs operate differently. Analysts move from doing the work to guiding the system —overseeing outcomes, validating AI decisions, and setting the policies that govern automation. Leaders must also adapt, learning to trust AI to assist analysts without replacing their judgment.
The motivation for this shift is straightforward:
The first step isn&#x27;t selecting a platform. It&#x27;s evolving the SOC model itself — and defining why the change is necessary.
AI-SOC Architectural Models and Delivery Framework
SACR&#x27;s AI-SOC Market Landscape 2025 defines the emerging market across four key dimensions — what the platform automates, how it&#x27;s delivered, how it integrates, and where it runs.
1. Functional Domain - What it automates
The first dimension describes what part of the SOC life-cycle the platform targets and how advanced its automation is.
Automation / Orchestration (SOAR+) &amp; Agentic SOC
These systems function as the SOC&#x27;s central nervous system , coordinating actions across SIEM, EDR, cloud, and ticketing tools. They combine deterministic rules with agentic AI that can reason, enrich alerts, and execute containment steps automatically.
Unlike traditional SOAR tools, they move beyond static playbooks — dynamically sequencing responses across multiple systems. Their strength lies in scale and consistency, making them well-suited for complex enterprise or MSSP environments.
Pure-Play Agentic Alert Triage
Focused on the SOC&#x27;s most persistent challenge: alert overload. These platforms deploy Agentic AI analysts to triage, investigate, and prioritize alerts, filtering false positives and escalating only validated threats.
This approach delivers immediate operational value by reducing Tier-1 workload and ensuring that every alert receives at least an initial level of investigation. For many teams, it represents the most practical starting point for adopting AI in the SOC, as it integrates easily with existing tools.
Analyst Co-Pilot / Investigation Assist
Acts as a digital assistant for human analysts. It helps generate queries, summarize evidence, and assemble context during investigations, improving speed and accuracy while keeping human judgment central.
Workflow / Knowledge Replication
Captures how experienced analysts investigate incidents and replays those workflows as repeatable automation. This model scales institutional knowledge and ensures consistency across teams, though it requires time and expert input to train effectively.
2. Implementation Model (How It&#x27;s Delivered)
This dimension defines how much control an organization retains over how automation is built, tuned, and maintained. SACR identifies two primary implementation models.
User-Defined / Configurable
These platforms offer partial to full flexibility. Security teams can design and adjust agents, detection logic, and workflows using scripting or low-to-no-code interfaces. The result is a SOC environment customized to internal processes — but one that requires skilled personnel and ongoing maintenance.
This model is typically favored by mature enterprises or managed service providers that value adaptability and ownership over simplicity.
Pre-Packaged / Black-Box
Delivered as ready-to-run solutions with vendor-managed agents and prebuilt workflows. These platforms can be deployed quickly, provide fast time-to-value, and benefit from continuous vendor R&amp;D. The trade-off is limited visibility into decision logic and less ability to customize.
They are best suited for teams prioritizing ease of use and rapid modernization over granular control.
3. Architecture Type (How It Integrates)
AI-SOC platforms differ in how they integrate into the broader SOC life-cycle and where they source and process data. SACR&#x27;s AI-SOC Market Landscape 2025 identifies three primary integration models, with Integrated AI-SOC Platforms emerging as the most comprehensive approach.
Integrated AI-SOC Platforms
These platforms ingest and analyze raw security logs directly, functioning as both an AI-SOC and, in many cases, a SIEM alternative. By maintaining their own data stores, they enable historical baselines, anomaly detection, and retrospective investigation, all within a unified system.
The key advantage is full visibility and analytical depth. Integrated platforms reduce dependence on external SIEMs, consolidate triage and response in one control plane, and significantly lower log-storage and licensing costs.
This model aligns closely with the industry&#x27;s move toward unified operations — where detection, investigation, and response happen in a single workflow instead of across stitched-together tools.
Connected &amp; Overlay Model (on Existing SOC/SIEM)
It adds an intelligent AI layer to current systems via APIs. The platform ingests alerts from tools such as SIEMs, EDRs, and cloud services, then enriches, triages, and reports results back to analysts.
Its appeal lies in speed. It delivers value quickly and requires no data migration or infrastructure changes. However, it relies on the quality of upstream alerts and offers limited behavioral analytics, since it typically lacks access to raw telemetry.
Human &amp;Browser-Based Workflow Emulation
This approach replicates how analysts work within existing interfaces, observing their actions and replaying investigations automatically. It helps scale expert knowledge and drive consistency, but requires initial setup and validated analyst workflows to perform effectively.
4. Deployment Model (Where It Runs)
Finally, deployment options determine where the AI-SOC operates and how data is managed.
Risks and Considerations When Adopting an AI-SOC Platform
AI-driven SOCs promise efficiency and speed, but also introduce new categories of potential risks. SACR highlights several, and additional considerations deserve equal attention.
Mitigating these risks starts with transparency — selecting solutions that provide explainability, flexible integration, strong governance, and a clear balance between automation and human control.
What to Ask Your AI-SOC Vendor
Selecting the right AI-SOC platform requires a structured, evidence-based evaluation.
SACR&#x27;s AI-SOC Market Landscape 2025 provides a strong foundation for due diligence, highlighting the questions that help security leaders separate proven capabilities from marketing claims.
Detection and Triage
These questions help determine how automation interacts with human oversight and how reliably the system maintains coverage without sacrificing accuracy.
Data Ownership and Privacy
Clarifying how data is managed, stored, and controlled ensures compliance with internal governance and external regulatory requirements.
Explainability and Human Control
These questions help confirm the level of transparency, explainability, and human control within the AI&#x27;s decision-making loop.
Integration and Tech-stack Fit
Understanding how the platform fits into the existing security stack helps prevent integration friction and avoid replacing one layer of complexity with another.
Pricing and Scalability
Cost structure, scalability, and deployment timelines are key to understanding both immediate and long-term return on investment.
An effective vendor evaluation balances technical depth with operational realism.
The most important questions are not just about what the AI can do, but also about how it does it , how it fits into existing workflows , and how its decisions can be understood, verified, and improved over time.
AI-SOC Adoption Framework
SACR outlines a straightforward, phased approach to AI-SOC adoption that balances speed with operational trust.
Organizations treating AI as a partner, not a replacement, see the most sustainable outcomes.
Measuring Success Over Time
Short-Term (0–3 months) Reduction in alert triage length Increased alert coverage percentage Reduction in alerts per analyst Mid-Term (3–9 months) Shorter mean time to respond (MTTR) At least a 35% reduction in false positives and manual investigations Reduced analyst burnout and turnover Long-Term (9 months +) Stable automation performance across incident types Predictable SOC operating costs Improved auditing and compliance reporting Each metric should relate to a business outcome. Focusing on high-value work can reduce missed alerts, improve response consistency, and increase analyst productivity.

Scaling the SOC with AI - Why now?
Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are under unprecedented pressure. According to SACR&#x27;s AI-SOC Market Landscape 2025 , the average organization now faces around 960 alerts per day , while large enterprises manage more than 3,000 alerts daily from an average of 28 different tools . Nearly 40% of those alerts go uninvestigated , and 61% of security teams admit to overlooking alerts that later proved critical.
The takeaway is clear: the traditional SOC model can&#x27;t keep up.
AI has now moved from experimentation to execution inside the SOC. 88% of organizations that don&#x27;t yet run an AI-driven SOC plan to evaluate or deploy one within the next year.
But as more vendors promote &quot;AI-powered SOC automation,&quot; the challenge for security leaders has shifted from awareness to evaluation. The key question is no longer whether AI belongs in the SOC, but how to measure its real impact and select a platform that delivers value without introducing significant risks.
This article provides a practical framework for doing just that. It explores AI-SOC architectures, implementation models, and risks, while outlining phased adoption strategies and the essential questions every organization should ask before choosing a platform.
The Mindset Shift: From Legacy to a Modern SOC
Building an AI-augmented SOC starts with a mindset shift, not a technology purchase.
Legacy SOCs depend on static rules, manual triage, and reactive workflows. Analysts spend hours chasing alerts and fine-tuning detections to manage noise — a model that doesn&#x27;t scale and fuels alert fatigue.
Modern SOCs operate differently. Analysts move from doing the work to guiding the system —overseeing outcomes, validating AI decisions, and setting the policies that govern automation. Leaders must also adapt, learning to trust AI to assist analysts without replacing their judgment.
The motivation for this shift is straightforward:
The first step isn&#x27;t selecting a platform. It&#x27;s evolving the SOC model itself — and defining why the change is necessary.
AI-SOC Architectural Models and Delivery Framework
SACR&#x27;s AI-SOC Market Landscape 2025 defines the emerging market across four key dimensions — what the platform automates, how it&#x27;s delivered, how it integrates, and where it runs.
1. Functional Domain - What it automates
The first dimension describes what part of the SOC life-cycle the platform targets and how advanced its automation is.
Automation / Orchestration (SOAR+) &amp; Agentic SOC
These systems function as the SOC&#x27;s central nervous system , coordinating actions across SIEM, EDR, cloud, and ticketing tools. They combine deterministic rules with agentic AI that can reason, enrich alerts, and execute containment steps automatically.
Unlike traditional SOAR tools, they move beyond static playbooks — dynamically sequencing responses across multiple systems. Their strength lies in scale and consistency, making them well-suited for complex enterprise or MSSP environments.
Pure-Play Agentic Alert Triage
Focused on the SOC&#x27;s most persistent challenge: alert overload. These platforms deploy Agentic AI analysts to triage, investigate, and prioritize alerts, filtering false positives and escalating only validated threats.
This approach delivers immediate operational value by reducing Tier-1 workload and ensuring that every alert receives at least an initial level of investigation. For many teams, it represents the most practical starting point for adopting AI in the SOC, as it integrates easily with existing tools.
Analyst Co-Pilot / Investigation Assist
Acts as a digital assistant for human analysts. It helps generate queries, summarize evidence, and assemble context during investigations, improving speed and accuracy while keeping human judgment central.
Workflow / Knowledge Replication
Captures how experienced analysts investigate incidents and replays those workflows as repeatable automation. This model scales institutional knowledge and ensures consistency across teams, though it requires time and expert input to train effectively.
2. Implementation Model (How It&#x27;s Delivered)
This dimension defines how much control an organization retains over how automation is built, tuned, and maintained. SACR identifies two primary implementation models.
User-Defined / Configurable
These platforms offer partial to full flexibility. Security teams can design and adjust agents, detection logic, and workflows using scripting or low-to-no-code interfaces. The result is a SOC environment customized to internal processes — but one that requires skilled personnel and ongoing maintenance.
This model is typically favored by mature enterprises or managed service providers that value adaptability and ownership over simplicity.
Pre-Packaged / Black-Box
Delivered as ready-to-run solutions with vendor-managed agents and prebuilt workflows. These platforms can be deployed quickly, provide fast time-to-value, and benefit from continuous vendor R&amp;D. The trade-off is limited visibility into decision logic and less ability to customize.
They are best suited for teams prioritizing ease of use and rapid modernization over granular control.
3. Architecture Type (How It Integrates)
AI-SOC platforms differ in how they integrate into the broader SOC life-cycle and where they source and process data. SACR&#x27;s AI-SOC Market Landscape 2025 identifies three primary integration models, with Integrated AI-SOC Platforms emerging as the most comprehensive approach.
Integrated AI-SOC Platforms
These platforms ingest and analyze raw security logs directly, functioning as both an AI-SOC and, in many cases, a SIEM alternative. By maintaining their own data stores, they enable historical baselines, anomaly detection, and retrospective investigation, all within a unified system.
The key advantage is full visibility and analytical depth. Integrated platforms reduce dependence on external SIEMs, consolidate triage and response in one control plane, and significantly lower log-storage and licensing costs.
This model aligns closely with the industry&#x27;s move toward unified operations — where detection, investigation, and response happen in a single workflow instead of across stitched-together tools.
Connected &amp; Overlay Model (on Existing SOC/SIEM)
It adds an intelligent AI layer to current systems via APIs. The platform ingests alerts from tools such as SIEMs, EDRs, and cloud services, then enriches, triages, and reports results back to analysts.
Its appeal lies in speed. It delivers value quickly and requires no data migration or infrastructure changes. However, it relies on the quality of upstream alerts and offers limited behavioral analytics, since it typically lacks access to raw telemetry.
Human &amp;Browser-Based Workflow Emulation
This approach replicates how analysts work within existing interfaces, observing their actions and replaying investigations automatically. It helps scale expert knowledge and drive consistency, but requires initial setup and validated analyst workflows to perform effectively.
4. Deployment Model (Where It Runs)
Finally, deployment options determine where the AI-SOC operates and how data is managed.
Risks and Considerations When Adopting an AI-SOC Platform
AI-driven SOCs promise efficiency and speed, but also introduce new categories of potential risks. SACR highlights several, and additional considerations deserve equal attention.
Mitigating these risks starts with transparency — selecting solutions that provide explainability, flexible integration, strong governance, and a clear balance between automation and human control.
What to Ask Your AI-SOC Vendor
Selecting the right AI-SOC platform requires a structured, evidence-based evaluation.
SACR&#x27;s AI-SOC Market Landscape 2025 provides a strong foundation for due diligence, highlighting the questions that help security leaders separate proven capabilities from marketing claims.
Detection and Triage
These questions help determine how automation interacts with human oversight and how reliably the system maintains coverage without sacrificing accuracy.
Data Ownership and Privacy
Clarifying how data is managed, stored, and controlled ensures compliance with internal governance and external regulatory requirements.
Explainability and Human Control
These questions help confirm the level of transparency, explainability, and human control within the AI&#x27;s decision-making loop.
Integration and Tech-stack Fit
Understanding how the platform fits into the existing security stack helps prevent integration friction and avoid replacing one layer of complexity with another.
Pricing and Scalability
Cost structure, scalability, and deployment timelines are key to understanding both immediate and long-term return on investment.
An effective vendor evaluation balances technical depth with operational realism.
The most important questions are not just about what the AI can do, but also about how it does it , how it fits into existing workflows , and how its decisions can be understood, verified, and improved over time.
AI-SOC Adoption Framework
SACR outlines a straightforward, phased approach to AI-SOC adoption that balances speed with operational trust.
Organizations treating AI as a partner, not a replacement, see the most sustainable outcomes.
Measuring Success Over Time
Short-Term (0–3 months) Reduction in alert triage length Increased alert coverage percentage Reduction in alerts per analyst Mid-Term (3–9 months) Shorter mean time to respond (MTTR) At least a 35% reduction in false positives and manual investigations Reduced analyst burnout and turnover Long-Term (9 months +) Stable automation performance across incident types Predictable SOC operating costs Improved auditing and compliance reporting Each metric should relate to a business outcome. Focusing on high-value work can reduce missed alerts, improve response consistency, and increase analyst productivity. Conclusion AI-SOC platforms are reshaping how security teams detect, investigate, and respond to threats at scale. But success depends on more than advanced technology.

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new campaign that exploited a recently disclosed security flaw impacting Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software to deploy Linux rootkits on older, unprotected systems.
The activity, codenamed Operation Zero Disco by Trend Micro, involves the weaponization of CVE-2025-20352 (CVSS score: 7.7), a stack overflow vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending crafted SNMP packets to a susceptible device. The intrusions have not been attributed to any known threat actor or group.
The shortcoming was patched by Cisco late last month, but not before it was exploited as a zero-day in real-world attacks.
&quot;The operation primarily impacted Cisco 9400, 9300, and legacy 3750G series devices, with additional attempts to exploit a modified Telnet vulnerability (based on CVE-2017-3881 ) to enable memory access,&quot; researchers Dove Chiu and Lucien Chuang said .
The cybersecurity company also noted that the rootkits allowed attackers to achieve remote code execution and gain persistent unauthorized access by setting universal passwords and installing hooks into the Cisco IOS daemon ( IOSd ) memory space. IOSd is run as a software process within the Linux kernel.
Another notable aspect of the attacks is that they singled out victims running older Linux systems that do not have endpoint detection response solutions enabled, making it possible to deploy the rootkits in order to fly under the radar. In addition, the adversary is said to have used spoofed IPs and Mac email addresses in their intrusions.
The rootkit is commandeered by means of a UDP controller component that that can serve as listener for incoming UDP packets on any port, toggle or disable log history, create a universal password by modifying IOSd memory, bypass AAA authentication, conceal certain portions of the running configuration, and hide changes made to the configuration by altering the timestamp to give the impression that it was never modified.
Besides CVE-2025-20352, the threat actors have also been observed attempting to exploit a Telnet vulnerability that is a modified version of CVE-2017-3881 so as to allow memory read/write at arbitrary addresses. However, the exact nature of the functionality remains unclear.
The name &quot;Zero Disco&quot; is a reference to the fact that the implanted rootkit sets a universal password that includes the word &quot;disco&quot; in it -- a one-letter change from &quot;Cisco.&quot;
&quot;The malware then installs several hooks onto the IOSd, which results in fileless components disappearing after a reboot,&quot; the researchers noted. &quot;Newer switch models provide some protection via Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), which reduces the success rate of intrusion attempts; however, it should be noted that repeated attempts can still succeed.&quot;

Penetration testing helps organizations ensure IT systems are secure, but it should never be treated in a one-size-fits-all approach. Traditional approaches can be rigid and cost your organization time and money – while producing inferior results.
The benefits of pen testing are clear. By empowering &quot;white hat&quot; hackers to attempt to breach your system using similar tools and techniques to an adversary, pen testing can provide reassurance that your IT set-up is secure. Perhaps more importantly, it can also flag areas for improvement.
As the UK&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) notes, it&#x27;s comparable to a financial audit .
&quot;Your finance team tracks expenditure and income day to day. An audit by an external group ensures that your internal team&#x27;s processes are sufficient.&quot;
While the advantages are obvious, it&#x27;s vital to understand the true cost of the process: indeed, the classic approach can often demand significant time and effort from your team. You need to get your money&#x27;s worth.
Pen testing hidden costs
There&#x27;s no one set form of pen test: it depends on what exactly is being tested, how often the pen test occurs, and how it takes place . Nevertheless, there are some common elements of the classic approach that could generate significant costs, both financially and in terms of your employees&#x27; time.
Let&#x27;s take a look at some of the costs that might not be immediately obvious.
Administrative overheads
There can be significant admin involved in arranging a &quot;traditional&quot; pen test. First, you need to coordinate schedules between your own organization and the testers you&#x27;ve hired to conduct the test on your behalf. This can cause significant disruption to your employees, distracting them from their day-to-day tasks.
What&#x27;s more, you&#x27;ll need to develop a clear overview of the resources and assets at your disposal before the test can occur, by gathering system inventories, for instance. You&#x27;ll also need to prepare access credentials for the hackers, depending on the type of pen testing approach you intend to take: for example, the testers may need these credentials to develop a scenario based on the risk of a disgruntled employee targeting your systems, for instance.
Scoping complexity
Again, determining the precise scope of the test is important – what is &quot;in-scope&quot; for the hackers, and what should remain out of scope?
This will be determined in-house, and will be built on several factors, depending on the precise needs of the organization; there may be certain applications, for instance, that cannot be included in the test. No matter the reasons, determining the overall scope of the testing will take time.
Of course, this isn&#x27;t set in stone: some organizations might deal with highly sophisticated environments, which change over time. You will need to devote resources to assessing the potential impact of these changes – as your environment changes, should you include new elements for the testers to target?
All of this raises the risk of &quot;scope creep&quot;, where a pen test grows beyond its original aims, creating additional work – and costs – for both the in-house team and the external testers.
Indirect costs
As we&#x27;ve seen, pen testing by its nature can pose significant risks of disruption for your team, including operational disruptions during the testing window. It&#x27;s vital to keep this under control right from the outset.
There&#x27;s also the time and costs associated with remediation, a somewhat ill-defined phase that could include consultation with the testers to overcome and solve any issues that might have arisen during the pen testing. This could even involve re-testing – launching yet another pen test to check that everything is now safe and secure.
All of this can add up to extra time and money for your organization.
Budget management challenges
You&#x27;ll also need to consider how you go about paying for the work . For instance, do you opt for a fixed-cost pricing model, where the testers provide a set rate? Or do you go for &quot;time and materials&quot;, where they provide an hourly rate based on estimated hours (or through another measure), but add in anything over these estimates?
&quot;There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s so hard to benchmark penetration testing costs: every test with every firm is unique,&quot; notes Network Assured, which provides independent pricing guidance on pen testing and other cybersecurity services.
That being the case, how can you go about getting the best return on investment and optimizing cost effectiveness?
Pen testing as a service (PTaaS)
To ensure you&#x27;re getting exactly the pen testing capability you need (at the right cost) an &quot;as-a-service&quot; approach can pay dividends. Such an approach can be customized to your needs, reducing the risks of unnecessary efforts.
For example, Outpost24&#x27;s CyberFlex combines the strengths of our Pen-testing-as-a-service (PTaaS) and External Attack Surface Management (EASM) solutions, providing continuous coverage of the application attack service on a flexible consumption model. This enables organizations to have full insight into their costs and capabilities, all while achieving the discovery, prioritization, and reporting needs they require.
Pen testing is crucial to defend your organization&#x27;s systems, but a cutting-edge capability doesn&#x27;t have to cost the world. By taking a smart approach, based on delivering the services you need at the right time, you can discover the vulnerabilities you need to address, without causing undue disruption or incurring unnecessary costs.

The online world is changing fast. Every week, new scams, hacks, and tricks show how easy it&#x27;s become to turn everyday technology into a weapon. Tools made to help us work, connect, and stay safe are now being used to steal, spy, and deceive.
Hackers don&#x27;t always break systems anymore — they use them. They hide inside trusted apps, copy real websites, and trick people into giving up control without even knowing it. It&#x27;s no longer just about stealing data — it&#x27;s about power, money, and control over how people live and communicate.
This week&#x27;s ThreatsDay issue looks at how that battle is unfolding — where criminals are getting smarter, where defenses are failing, and what that means for anyone living in a connected world.

The U.S. government has seized $15 billion (approximately 127,271 bitcoin) worth of cryptocurrency assets from one of the world&#x27;s largest operators of forced-labor scam compounds across Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos, which are known to conduct romance baiting (aka pig butchering or Shā Zhū Pán) schemes to defraud victims under the pretext of increased returns. The perpetrators, operating from the scam compounds under the threat of violence, often built relationships with their victims over time, earning their trust before stealing their funds. The Department of Justice (DoJ) unsealed an indictment against the Prince Group and its 38-year-old CEO, Chen Zhi (aka Vincent). &quot;Individuals held against their will in the compounds engaged in cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes, known as &#x27;pig butchering&#x27; scams, that stole billions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world,&quot; the DoJ said . &quot;Trafficked workers were confined in prison-like compounds and forced to carry out online scams on an industrial scale, preying on thousands worldwide.&quot; Zhi, the alleged kingpin behind the sprawling cybercrime empire, is at large. The department also said the seized funds represent &quot;proceeds and instrumentalities of the defendant&#x27;s fraud and money laundering schemes&quot; and were stored in unhosted cryptocurrency wallets whose private keys the defendant had in his possession. The compounds operated out of casinos and luxury hotels owned by the Group. Some of the stolen proceeds were spent on luxury goods, including yachts, private jets, art, and even a Picasso painting. In tandem, the U.S. and the U.K. designated Prince Group as a transnational criminal organization and announced sanctions against the defendant. Other proxy organizations targeted by the sanctions include Jin Bei Group, Golden Fortune Resorts World, and Byex Exchange. Elliptic said the $15 billion seized by the U.S. was &quot; stolen &quot; in 2020 from LuBian, a bitcoin mining business with operations in China and Iran. LuBian, per the blockchain analytics company, was one of the ostensibly legal business enterprises overseen by Prince Group. &quot;Pig butchering has exploded into an industrialized fraud economy generating tens of billions of dollars annually,&quot; Infoblox said . &quot;Sophisticated Asian crime syndicates have proven adept at spinning up hundreds of disposable websites in minutes, overwhelming governments that cannot detect or block them fast enough to shield victims.&quot;
Kaspersky has revealed that the newly discovered banking trojan dubbed Maverick targeting Brazilian users using a WhatsApp worm named SORVEPOTEL shares many code overlaps with Coyote . &quot;Once installed, the trojan uses the open-source project WPPConnect to automate the sending of messages in hijacked accounts via WhatsApp Web, taking advantage of the access to send the malicious message to contacts,&quot; the Russian security vendor said . &quot;The Maverick trojan checks the time zone, language, region, and date and time format on infected machines to ensure the victim is in Brazil; otherwise, the malware will not be installed.&quot; The malware monitors victims&#x27; access to 26 Brazilian bank websites, six cryptocurrency exchange websites, and one payment platform to facilitate credential theft. It also comes with capabilities to fully control the infected computer, take screenshots, install a keylogger, control the mouse, block the screen when accessing a banking website, terminate processes, and open phishing pages in an overlay. Kaspersky said it has blocked 62,000 infection attempts using the malicious LNK file shared via WhatsApp in the first 10 days of October, only in Brazil, indicating a large-scale campaign.
A new study from a team of academics from the University of Maryland and the University of California, San Diego has found that it&#x27;s possible to intercept and spy on 39 geostationary satellite communications traffic from the U.S. military, telecommunications firms, major businesses, and organizations using a consumer-grade satellite dish installed on the roof of their building. Intercepted data comprised mobile carrier calls and text messages, VoIP call audio, login credentials, corporate emails, inventory records, and ATM networking information belonging to retail, financial, and banking companies, military and government secrets associated with coastal vessel surveillance, and web browsing activities of in-flight Wi-Fi users. &quot;A shockingly large amount of sensitive traffic is being broadcast unencrypted, including critical infrastructure, internal corporate and government communications, private citizens&#x27; voice calls and SMS, and consumer Internet traffic from in-flight wifi and mobile networks,&quot; the researchers said . &quot;This data can be passively observed by anyone with a few hundred dollars of consumer-grade hardware.&quot; Following disclosure, T-Mobile has moved to encrypt its satellite communications.
Legacy Windows communication protocols such as NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) and Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR), continue to expose organizations to credential theft, without the need for exploiting software vulnerabilities. &quot;The weakness of LLMNR and NBT-NS is that they accept responses from any device without authentication,&quot; Resecurity said . &quot;This allows an attacker on the same subnet to respond to name resolution requests and trick a system into sending authentication attempts. Using tools such as Responder, the attacker can capture NTLMv2 hashes, usernames, and domain details, which can then be cracked offline or relayed to other services.&quot; Given that Windows falls back to LLMNR or NBT-NS when it cannot resolve a hostname through DNS, it can open the door to LLMNR and NBT-NS poisoning. &quot;By simply being on the same subnet, an attacker can impersonate trusted systems, capture NTLMv2 hashes, and potentially recover cleartext credentials,&quot; the company added. &quot;From there, they gain the ability to access sensitive data, move laterally, and escalate privileges without ever exploiting a software vulnerability.&quot; To guard against the threat, it&#x27;s advised to disable LLMNR and NBT-NS, encore secure authentication methods such as Kerberos, and harden LDAP and Active Directory against NTLM relay attacks.
Hundreds of users are estimated to have had their sensitive information stolen through a compromised website belonging to video game software development company Unity Technologies. The malicious skimmer, injected into the checkout page of Unity SpeedTree, was designed to harvest the information entered by individuals who made purchases on the SpeedTree site, including name, address, email address, payment card number, and access code. According to a filing with the Maine Attorney General&#x27;s Office, the incident impacted 428 individuals. The affected customers are being notified and offered free credit monitoring and identity protection services. The breach was discovered on August 26, 2025.
Smishing campaigns carried out by Chinese cybercrime groups that distribute fake SMS messages to U.S. users about package deliveries and toll road payments have made more than $1 billion over the last three years, The Wall Street Journal reported , citing the Department of Homeland Security. The scam, made possible via phishing kits sold on Telegram, is designed to steal victims&#x27; credit card details and then use them in Google and Apple Wallets in Asia and the U.S. to make unauthorized purchases, such as gift cards, iPhones, clothing, and cosmetics. The messages are sent via SIM farms, with about 200 SIM boxes operating in at least 38 farms across the U.S. According to Proofpoint, as many as 330,000 toll scam messages were sent to Americans in a single day last month. A previous report from SecAlliance in August 2025 noted that Chinese smishing syndicates may have compromised between 12.7 million and 115 million payment cards in the U.S. alone between July 2023 and October 2024. The criminal ecosystem has since evolved to include the sale of pre-positioned devices loaded with stolen cards, indicating an evolution of the monetization strategy.
A sophisticated campaign targeting macOS users has employed fake Homebrew installer websites (homebrewfaq[.]org, homebrewclubs[.]org, and homebrewupdate[.]org) that deliver malicious payloads. The attack exploits the widespread trust users place in the popular Homebrew package manager by creating pixel-perfect replicas of the official brew[.]sh installation page, and combining it with deceptive clipboard manipulation techniques. The spoofed sites incorporate hidden JavaScript designed to inject additional commands into users&#x27; clipboards without their knowledge during the installation phase when unsuspecting users attempt to copy the command to install the tool. It&#x27;s assessed that the attack chain is being used to deliver Odyssey Stealer. Previous campaigns have used fake Homebrew pages to trick users into installing Cuckoo Stealer.
The U.K.&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) reported 204 &quot;national significant&quot; cyber incidents between September 2024 and August 2025. The number represents an 130% increase compared to the previous year, when U.K. organizations faced 89 incidents of such high impact. Of these, 18 were classified as highly significant incidents. The disclosure comes as Bloomberg revealed that Chinese state actors systemically and successfully compromised classified U.K. government computer systems for more than a decade, accessing low- and medium-level classified information. The data accessed included confidential documents relating to the formulation of government policy, private communications, and some diplomatic cables, the report added.
Around 200,000 Linux computer systems from American computer maker Framework have been found to be shipped with signed UEFI shell components that could be exploited to bypass Secure Boot protections. An attacker could take advantage of the issues to load bootkits that can evade operating system-level security controls and survive re-installs of the operating system. The vulnerabilities have been codenamed BombShell by Eclypsium. &quot;At the heart of this issue is a seemingly innocent command: mm (memory modify),&quot; the firmware security company said . &quot;This command, present in many UEFI shells, provides direct read and write access to system memory. While this capability is essential for legitimate diagnostics, it&#x27;s also the perfect tool for bypassing every security control in the system.&quot; Framework has released security updates to address the vulnerabilities.
Cybercriminals have unleashed a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting Colombian users through deceptive judicial notifications, deploying a complex multi-stage malware delivery system that culminates in delivery of AsyncRAT. The attack campaign employs carefully crafted Spanish-language emails impersonating official correspondence from the Colombia court system, informing recipients of purported lawsuits filed against them and tricking them into opening SVG file attachments that lead to fake landing pages so as to download the document, which is an HTML Application responsible for activating a series of interim payloads to deploy AsyncRAT.
Google has added new protections to Google Messages and account recovery methods to secure people against scams. This includes the ability to block users from visiting links shared on Messages that have been flagged as spam, unless users explicitly mark the texts as &quot;not spam.&quot; The company has also added the option to regain access to the Google Account by means of a &quot;Sign in with Mobile Number&quot; option. &quot;All you need is the lock-screen passcode from your previous device for verification, no password needed,&quot; it said. Another new feature includes Recovery Contacts , which allows users to choose trusted friends or family members to make it easier to recover access to the account in case it gets locked out due to a device being stolen. Last but not least, Google said it&#x27;s also making the Key Verifier available to all Android 10+ users for an extra layer of security when chatting via Google Messages by ensuring that users are communicating with the person they intend to and not somebody else.
A C# malware loader called PhantomVAI Loader is being distributed via phishing emails bearing shipment lures to deliver stealers and remote access trojans like AsyncRAT, XWorm, Formbook, and DCRat. &quot;The loader initially used in these campaigns was dubbed Katz Stealer Loader [aka VMDetectLoader ], for the Katz Stealer malware that it delivers,&quot; Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said . &quot;Hackers are selling this new infostealer on underground forums as malware as a service (MaaS).&quot; Phishing campaigns deploying PhantomVAI Loader have targeted a wide spectrum of sectors globally, including manufacturing, education, utilities, technology, healthcare, and government. The phishing emails contain zipped JavaScript or Visual Basic Script files that launch PowerShell, responsible for dropping the loader in the form of a GIF image, which then proceeds to run virtual machine checks, establish persistence, and inject MSBuild.exe with the next-stage payload using a technique called process hollowing .
A nascent toolkit named Whisper 2FA has emerged as the third most common phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) after Tycoon and EvilProxy. Barracuda said it has detected close to a million Whisper 2FA attacks targeting Microsoft accounts in multiple huge phishing campaigns in the last month. Whisper 2FA has been found to share similarities with another PhaaS kit named Salty 2FA . &quot;Whisper 2FA&#x27;s defining trait is its ability to steal credentials multiple times through a real-time credential exfiltration loop enabled by a web technology known as AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML),&quot; security researcher Deerendra Prasad said . &quot;The attackers keep the loop going until they obtain a valid multi-factor authentication token.&quot; The phishing kit is assessed to be under active development, with the authors progressively adding more layers of obfuscation and protections to block debugging tools and crash browser inspection tools. &quot;As phishing kits like this continue to evolve, organizations need to move past static defenses and adopt layered strategies: user training, phishing-resistant MFA, continuous monitoring, and threat intelligence sharing,&quot; Prasad added.
The Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLSH) cybercrime group, comprised primarily of English-speaking teenagers combining elements of Scattered Spider, LAPSUS$, and ShinyHunters, has announced it will go dark until 2026 following the FBI&#x27;s seizure of its clearnet data leak site . &quot;As per the exceptional circumstances by which the FBI tried to obliterate our legacy, we&#x27;ve exceptionally decided to temporarily renounce to oblivion [sic] and promptly hack them back,&quot; one member wrote on October 11. &quot;We shall now dissolve again in the ether. Good night.&quot; In a follow-up message, it said: &quot;I promise you, you will feel our wrath.&quot; The extortion crew has since published data allegedly belonging to six of the 39 targeted companies, including Qantas, Albertsons, GAP, Vietnam Airlines, Fujifilm, and Engie Resources, per DataBreaches.net.
Cybersecurity researchers have documented a rise in cyber attacks exploiting remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools for initial access via phishing email alerts warning of fake login to recipients&#x27; ConnectWise ScreenConnect instances. Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and ransomware crews have leveraged legitimate RMM platforms, including AnyDesk, ScreenConnect, UltraViewer, AppAnywhere, RustDesk, CloneDesk, Splashtop, and TightVNC, to gain unauthorized control of systems. The researchers found that threat actors are also exploiting ScreenConnect&#x27;s legitimate features, such as unattended access and interactive desktop control, to establish persistence and move laterally within compromised networks. &quot;Their administrative power, combined with custom installers, invite links, and public URLs, makes them high-value targets,&quot; DarkAtlas said .
German and Bulgarian authorities have seized 1,406 websites that were used for perpetrating large-scale financial scams. The sites, taken offline at the start of the month, lured users to invest in cryptocurrency on fraudulent trading platforms and then disappeared with their funds. Officials said the platforms did not have the necessary permission from BaFin to provide financial or securities services and banking transactions. They also said more than 866,000 attempts to access the sites were recorded over a period of ten days after they were seized on October 3, 2025, underscoring the attackers&#x27; success in pulling off the scheme. In mid-June 2025, around 800 illegal domains were blocked as part of a similar effort.
NVIDIA has rolled out fixes for two vulnerabilities in NVIDIA&#x27;s Display Driver for Linux (CVE-2025-23280 and CVE-2025-23330) that can be triggered by an attacker controlling a local unprivileged process to achieve kernel read and write primitives. Quarkslab, which discovered and reported the flaws in June 2025, has released a complete proof-of-concept exploit.
Cyble and iVerify have detailed two new Android malware families called GhostBat RAT and HyperRat that can steal sensitive data from compromised devices. &quot;Operators can fetch logs, send notifications, dispatch an SMS from the infected user&#x27;s SIM, download archived messages, inspect the call log, view or modify granted permissions, browse installed applications, and even establish a VNC session,&quot; iVerify security researcher Daniel Kelley said about HyperRat. The web-based command-and-control (C2) panel supports the ability to create custom APK files using a builder, serve fake login overlays atop installed apps, and an option to facilitate downstream spam or phishing campaigns via a mass messaging button. GhostBat RAT, on the other hand, has been observed targeting Indian Android users via bogus apps distributed via WhatsApp and SMS messages containing links to compromised websites and GitHub. Once installed, the malware uses phishing pages to capture banking credentials and UPI PINs. It can also exfiltrate SMS messages containing banking-related keywords, with select variants including cryptocurrency mining capabilities. &quot;The GhostBat RAT samples included multi-stage dropper workflows, native binary packing, deliberate corruption/manipulation of ZIP headers, runtime anti-emulation checks, and heavy string obfuscation, complicating reverse engineering,&quot; Cyble noted .
Brazilian law enforcement authorities have disrupted a sophisticated criminal network that has been accused of laundering about $540 million. The sweeping operation, codenamed Lusocoin, saw 13 searches and 11 temporary arrests, as well as the seizure of six luxury vehicles and six high-value properties. Assets totaling more than 3 billion Brazilian reais (about $540 million) have been subjected to court-ordered freezes. Officials said the network operated as an international money-laundering and foreign-exchange evasion scheme, converting illicit profits from drug trafficking, smuggling, tax evasion, and even terrorism financing into cryptocurrency assets to hide the source of funds. In all, the group is believed to have moved more than $9 billion through its ecosystem of shell companies, exchanges, and digital wallets.
New research has found that it&#x27;s possible to leverage Amazon&#x27;s distributed application tracing service AWS X-Ray as a covert C2 server, essentially turning cloud monitoring infrastructure to establish bidirectional communication. &quot;AWS X-Ray was designed to help developers understand application performance by collecting traces,&quot; security researcher Dhiraj Mishra said . &quot;However, X-Ray annotations can store arbitrary key-value data, and the service provides APIs to both write and query this data.&quot; An attacker can weaponize this behavior to implant a beacon on the target system and subsequently control it by issuing an HTTP PUT request containing a Base64 command to the X-Ray service&#x27;s &quot; /TraceSegments &quot; endpoint, from where the victim machine fetches the malicious trace during the polling phase and then decodes and executes the embedded command within it. The results of the command execution are exfiltrated to the X-Ray service, allowing the attacker to access the result traces by sending an HTTP GET request to the &quot; /TraceSummaries &quot; endpoint.
Seven security vulnerabilities (from CVE-2025-54246 through CVE-2025-54252) have been disclosed in Adobe Experience Manager that could result in security feature bypass and allow attackers to gain unauthorized read/write access. The issues, which were reported by Searchlight Cyber&#x27;s Assetnote team in June 2025, were fixed by Adobe last month. There is no evidence that they were exploited in the wild.
Google has reached a settlement agreement over its use of an open-source dataset named Diversity in Faces that allegedly contained images of people from the U.S. state of Illinois for training its facial recognition algorithms in violation of the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The dataset was created in 2019 by IBM to address existing biases in overwhelmingly light-skinned and male-dominated facial datasets. According to plaintiffs, some of the images were pulled from a Flickr dataset that featured biometric data of people from Illinois. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The case was originally filed in 2020, with lawsuits also filed against Amazon and Microsoft for similar violations.
A new report from Chainalysis has revealed that cryptocurrency balances linked to illicit activity exceed $75 billion. This includes about $15 billion held directly by illicit entities and more than $60 billion in wallets with downstream exposure to those entities. &quot;Darknet market administrators and vendors alone control over $40 billion in on-chain value,&quot; the blockchain intelligence firm said. Earlier this year, Chainalysis disclosed that more than $40 billion in cryptocurrency was laundered in 2024 alone, most of it through wallets and mixers that leave no trace in standard compliance systems.

The line between safe and exposed online is thinner than ever. What used to be rare, complex attacks are now everyday events, run by organized groups who treat cybercrime like a business. It&#x27;s no longer just about protecting devices — it&#x27;s about protecting people, trust, and truth in a digital world that never stops moving.
Staying secure doesn&#x27;t mean chasing every headline. It means understanding how these threats work, paying attention to the small signs, and not letting convenience replace caution. The same tools that make life easier can turn against us — but awareness is still the best defense.
Stay alert, stay curious, and don&#x27;t assume safety — build it.

"><div class="cell-inner"><div class="cell-content">ThreatsDay Bulletin: $15B Crypto Bust, Satellite Spying, Billion-Dollar Smishing, Android RATs &amp; More
The online world is changing fast. Every week, new scams, hacks, and tricks show how easy it&#x27;s become to turn everyday technology into a weapon. Tools made to help us work, connect, and stay safe are now being used to steal, spy, and deceive.
Hackers don&#x27;t always break systems anymore — they use them. They hide inside trusted apps, copy real websites, and trick people into giving up control without even knowing it. It&#x27;s no longer just about stealing data — it&#x27;s about power, money, and control over how people live and communicate.
This week&#x27;s ThreatsDay issue looks at how that battle is unfolding — where criminals are getting smarter, where defenses are failing, and what that means for anyone living in a connected world.

The U.S. government has seized $15 billion (approximately 127,271 bitcoin) worth of cryptocurrency assets from one of the world&#x27;s largest operators of forced-labor scam compounds across Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos, which are known to conduct romance baiting (aka pig butchering or Shā Zhū Pán) schemes to defraud victims under the pretext of increased returns. The perpetrators, operating from the scam compounds under the threat of violence, often built relationships with their victims over time, earning their trust before stealing their funds. The Department of Justice (DoJ) unsealed an indictment against the Prince Group and its 38-year-old CEO, Chen Zhi (aka Vincent). &quot;Individuals held against their will in the compounds engaged in cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes, known as &#x27;pig butchering&#x27; scams, that stole billions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world,&quot; the DoJ said . &quot;Trafficked workers were confined in prison-like compounds and forced to carry out online scams on an industrial scale, preying on thousands worldwide.&quot; Zhi, the alleged kingpin behind the sprawling cybercrime empire, is at large. The department also said the seized funds represent &quot;proceeds and instrumentalities of the defendant&#x27;s fraud and money laundering schemes&quot; and were stored in unhosted cryptocurrency wallets whose private keys the defendant had in his possession. The compounds operated out of casinos and luxury hotels owned by the Group. Some of the stolen proceeds were spent on luxury goods, including yachts, private jets, art, and even a Picasso painting. In tandem, the U.S. and the U.K. designated Prince Group as a transnational criminal organization and announced sanctions against the defendant. Other proxy organizations targeted by the sanctions include Jin Bei Group, Golden Fortune Resorts World, and Byex Exchange. Elliptic said the $15 billion seized by the U.S. was &quot; stolen &quot; in 2020 from LuBian, a bitcoin mining business with operations in China and Iran. LuBian, per the blockchain analytics company, was one of the ostensibly legal business enterprises overseen by Prince Group. &quot;Pig butchering has exploded into an industrialized fraud economy generating tens of billions of dollars annually,&quot; Infoblox said . &quot;Sophisticated Asian crime syndicates have proven adept at spinning up hundreds of disposable websites in minutes, overwhelming governments that cannot detect or block them fast enough to shield victims.&quot;
Kaspersky has revealed that the newly discovered banking trojan dubbed Maverick targeting Brazilian users using a WhatsApp worm named SORVEPOTEL shares many code overlaps with Coyote . &quot;Once installed, the trojan uses the open-source project WPPConnect to automate the sending of messages in hijacked accounts via WhatsApp Web, taking advantage of the access to send the malicious message to contacts,&quot; the Russian security vendor said . &quot;The Maverick trojan checks the time zone, language, region, and date and time format on infected machines to ensure the victim is in Brazil; otherwise, the malware will not be installed.&quot; The malware monitors victims&#x27; access to 26 Brazilian bank websites, six cryptocurrency exchange websites, and one payment platform to facilitate credential theft. It also comes with capabilities to fully control the infected computer, take screenshots, install a keylogger, control the mouse, block the screen when accessing a banking website, terminate processes, and open phishing pages in an overlay. Kaspersky said it has blocked 62,000 infection attempts using the malicious LNK file shared via WhatsApp in the first 10 days of October, only in Brazil, indicating a large-scale campaign.

NVIDIA has rolled out fixes for two vulnerabilities in NVIDIA&#x27;s Display Driver for Linux (CVE-2025-23280 and CVE-2025-23330) that can be triggered by an attacker controlling a local unprivileged process to achieve kernel read and write primitives. Quarkslab, which discovered and reported the flaws in June 2025, has released a complete proof-of-concept exploit.
Cyble and iVerify have detailed two new Android malware families called GhostBat RAT and HyperRat that can steal sensitive data from compromised devices. &quot;Operators can fetch logs, send notifications, dispatch an SMS from the infected user&#x27;s SIM, download archived messages, inspect the call log, view or modify granted permissions, browse installed applications, and even establish a VNC session,&quot; iVerify security researcher Daniel Kelley said about HyperRat. The web-based command-and-control (C2) panel supports the ability to create custom APK files using a builder, serve fake login overlays atop installed apps, and an option to facilitate downstream spam or phishing campaigns via a mass messaging button. GhostBat RAT, on the other hand, has been observed targeting Indian Android users via bogus apps distributed via WhatsApp and SMS messages containing links to compromised websites and GitHub. Once installed, the malware uses phishing pages to capture banking credentials and UPI PINs. It can also exfiltrate SMS messages containing banking-related keywords, with select variants including cryptocurrency mining capabilities. &quot;The GhostBat RAT samples included multi-stage dropper workflows, native binary packing, deliberate corruption/manipulation of ZIP headers, runtime anti-emulation checks, and heavy string obfuscation, complicating reverse engineering,&quot; Cyble noted .
Brazilian law enforcement authorities have disrupted a sophisticated criminal network that has been accused of laundering about $540 million. The sweeping operation, codenamed Lusocoin, saw 13 searches and 11 temporary arrests, as well as the seizure of six luxury vehicles and six high-value properties. Assets totaling more than 3 billion Brazilian reais (about $540 million) have been subjected to court-ordered freezes. Officials said the network operated as an international money-laundering and foreign-exchange evasion scheme, converting illicit profits from drug trafficking, smuggling, tax evasion, and even terrorism financing into cryptocurrency assets to hide the source of funds. In all, the group is believed to have moved more than $9 billion through its ecosystem of shell companies, exchanges, and digital wallets.
New research has found that it&#x27;s possible to leverage Amazon&#x27;s distributed application tracing service AWS X-Ray as a covert C2 server, essentially turning cloud monitoring infrastructure to establish bidirectional communication. &quot;AWS X-Ray was designed to help developers understand application performance by collecting traces,&quot; security researcher Dhiraj Mishra said . &quot;However, X-Ray annotations can store arbitrary key-value data, and the service provides APIs to both write and query this data.&quot; An attacker can weaponize this behavior to implant a beacon on the target system and subsequently control it by issuing an HTTP PUT request containing a Base64 command to the X-Ray service&#x27;s &quot; /TraceSegments &quot; endpoint, from where the victim machine fetches the malicious trace during the polling phase and then decodes and executes the embedded command within it. The results of the command execution are exfiltrated to the X-Ray service, allowing the attacker to access the result traces by sending an HTTP GET request to the &quot; /TraceSummaries &quot; endpoint.
Seven security vulnerabilities (from CVE-2025-54246 through CVE-2025-54252) have been disclosed in Adobe Experience Manager that could result in security feature bypass and allow attackers to gain unauthorized read/write access. The issues, which were reported by Searchlight Cyber&#x27;s Assetnote team in June 2025, were fixed by Adobe last month. There is no evidence that they were exploited in the wild.
Google has reached a settlement agreement over its use of an open-source dataset named Diversity in Faces that allegedly contained images of people from the U.S. state of Illinois for training its facial recognition algorithms in violation of the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The dataset was created in 2019 by IBM to address existing biases in overwhelmingly light-skinned and male-dominated facial datasets. According to plaintiffs, some of the images were pulled from a Flickr dataset that featured biometric data of people from Illinois. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The case was originally filed in 2020, with lawsuits also filed against Amazon and Microsoft for similar violations.
A new report from Chainalysis has revealed that cryptocurrency balances linked to illicit activity exceed $75 billion. This includes about $15 billion held directly by illicit entities and more than $60 billion in wallets with downstream exposure to those entities. &quot;Darknet market administrators and vendors alone control over $40 billion in on-chain value,&quot; the blockchain intelligence firm said. Earlier this year, Chainalysis disclosed that more than $40 billion in cryptocurrency was laundered in 2024 alone, most of it through wallets and mixers that leave no trace in standard compliance systems.

The line between safe and exposed online is thinner than ever. What used to be rare, complex attacks are now everyday events, run by organized groups who treat cybercrime like a business. It&#x27;s no longer just about protecting devices — it&#x27;s about protecting people, trust, and truth in a digital world that never stops moving.
Staying secure doesn&#x27;t mean chasing every headline. It means understanding how these threats work, paying attention to the small signs, and not letting convenience replace caution. The same tools that make life easier can turn against us — but awareness is still the best defense.
Stay alert, stay curious, and don&#x27;t assume safety — build it.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Wednesday added a critical security flaw impacting Adobe Experience Manager to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-54253 (CVSS score: 10.0), a maximum-severity misconfiguration bug that could result in arbitrary code execution.
According to Adobe, the shortcoming impacts Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms on JEE versions 6.5.23.0 and earlier. It was addressed in version 6.5.0-0108 released early August 2025, alongside CVE-2025-54254 (CVSS score: 8.6).
Details of the two vulnerabilities were disclosed by Searchlight Cyber researchers Adam Kues and Shubham Shah in July 2025, describing CVE-2025-54253 as an &quot;authentication bypass to [remote code execution] chain via Struts2 devmode&quot; and CVE-2025-54254 as an XML external entity (XXE) injection within AEM Forms web services.
The flaw results from the dangerously exposed /adminui/debug servlet, which evaluates user-supplied OGNL expressions as Java code without requiring authentication or input validation,&quot; security company FireCompass noted . &quot;The endpoint&#x27;s misuse enables attackers to execute arbitrary system commands with a single crafted HTTP request.&quot;
There is currently no information publicly available on how the security flaw is being exploited in real-world attacks, although Adobe acknowledged in its advisory that &quot;CVE-2025-54253 and CVE-2025-54254 have a publicly available proof-of-concept.&quot;
In light of active exploitation, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are advised to apply the necessary fixes by November 5, 2025.
The development comes a day after CISA also added a critical improper authentication vulnerability in SKYSEA Client View (CVE-2016-7836, CVSS score: 9.8) to the KEV catalog. Japan Vulnerability Notes (JVN), in an advisory released in late 2016, said &quot;attacks exploiting this vulnerability have been observed in the wild.&quot;
&quot;SKYSEA Client View contains an improper authentication vulnerability that allows remote code execution via a flaw in processing authentication on the TCP connection with the management console program,&quot; the agency said.

A threat actor with ties to China has been attributed to a five-month-long intrusion targeting a Russian IT service provider, marking the hacking group&#x27;s expansion to the country beyond Southeast Asia and South America.
The activity, which took place from January to May 2025, has been attributed by Broadcom-owned Symantec to a threat actor it tracks as Jewelbug , which it said overlaps with clusters known as CL-STA-0049 (Palo Alto Networks Unit 42), Earth Alux (Trend Micro), and REF7707 (Elastic Security Labs).
The findings suggest Russia is not off-limits for Chinese cyber espionage operations despite increased &quot;military, economic, and diplomatic&quot; relations between Moscow and Beijing over the years.
&quot;Attackers had access to code repositories and software build systems that they could potentially leverage to carry out supply chain attacks targeting the company&#x27;s customers in Russia,&quot; the Symantec Threat Hunter Team said in a report shared with The Hacker News. &quot;Notably too, the attackers were exfiltrating data to Yandex Cloud.&quot;
Earth Alux is assessed to be active since at least the second quarter of 2023, with attacks primarily targeting government, technology, logistics, manufacturing, telecommunications, IT services, and retail in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Latin American (LATAM) regions to deliver malware like VARGEIT and COBEACON (aka Cobalt Strike Beacon).
The attacks mounted by CL-STA-0049/REF7707, on the other hand, have been observed distributing an advanced backdoor named FINALDRAFT (aka Squidoor) that&#x27;s capable of infecting both Windows and Linux systems. The findings from Symantec mark the first time these two activity clusters have been tied together.
In the attack aimed at the Russian IT service provider, Jewelbug is said to have leveraged a renamed version of Microsoft Console Debugger (&quot;cdb.exe&quot;), which can be used to run shellcode and bypass application allowlisting, as well as launch executables, run DLLs, and terminate security solutions.
The threat actor has also been observed dumping credentials, establishing persistence via scheduled tasks, and attempting to conceal traces of their activity by clearing Windows Event Logs.
The targeting of IT service providers is strategic as it opens the door to possible supply chain attacks, enabling threat actors to leverage the compromise to breach several downstream customers at once through malicious software updates.
Furthermore, Jewelbug has also been linked to an intrusion at a large South American government organization in July 2025, deploying a previously undocumented backdoor that&#x27;s said to be under development – underscoring the group&#x27;s evolving capabilities. The malware uses Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive for command-and-control (C2), and can collect system information, enumerate files from targeted machines, and upload the information to OneDrive.
The use of Microsoft Graph API allows the threat actor to blend in with normal network traffic and leaves minimal forensic artifacts, complicating post-incident analysis and prolonging dwell time for threat actors.
Other targets include an IT provider based in South Asia and a Taiwanese company in October and November 2024, with the attack on the latter leveraging DLL side-loading techniques to drop malicious payloads, including ShadowPad , a backdoor exclusively used by Chinese hacking groups.
The infection chain is also characterized by the deployment of the KillAV tool to disable security software and a publicly available tool named EchoDrv, which permits abuse of the kernel read/write vulnerability in the ECHOAC anti-cheat driver, as part of what appears to be a bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) attack.
Also leveraged were LSASS and Mimikatz for dumping credentials, freely available tools like PrintNotifyPotato, Coerced Potato, and Sweet Potato for discovery and privilege escalation, and a SOCKS tunneling utility dubbed EarthWorm that has been used by Chinese hacking crews like Gelsemium, Lucky Mouse, and Velvet Ant.
The Symantec Threat Hunter Team told The Hacker News that they could not confirm the infection vector used to breach the organizations in all the incidents discussed above.
&quot;Jewelbug&#x27;s preference for using cloud services and other legitimate tools in its operations indicates that remaining under the radar and establishing a stealthy and persistent presence on victim networks is of utmost importance to this group,&quot; Symantec said.

"><div class="cell-inner"><div class="cell-content">Chinese Threat Group &#x27;Jewelbug&#x27; Quietly Infiltrated Russian IT Network for Months
A threat actor with ties to China has been attributed to a five-month-long intrusion targeting a Russian IT service provider, marking the hacking group&#x27;s expansion to the country beyond Southeast Asia and South America.
The activity, which took place from January to May 2025, has been attributed by Broadcom-owned Symantec to a threat actor it tracks as Jewelbug , which it said overlaps with clusters known as CL-STA-0049 (Palo Alto Networks Unit 42), Earth Alux (Trend Micro), and REF7707 (Elastic Security Labs).
The findings suggest Russia is not off-limits for Chinese cyber espionage operations despite increased &quot;military, economic, and diplomatic&quot; relations between Moscow and Beijing over the years.
&quot;Attackers had access to code repositories and software build systems that they could potentially leverage to carry out supply chain attacks targeting the company&#x27;s customers in Russia,&quot; the Symantec Threat Hunter Team said in a report shared with The Hacker News. &quot;Notably too, the attackers were exfiltrating data to Yandex Cloud.&quot;
Earth Alux is assessed to be active since at least the second quarter of 2023, with attacks primarily targeting government, technology, logistics, manufacturing, telecommunications, IT services, and retail in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Latin American (LATAM) regions to deliver malware like VARGEIT and COBEACON (aka Cobalt Strike Beacon).
The attacks mounted by CL-STA-0049/REF7707, on the other hand, have been observed distributing an advanced backdoor named FINALDRAFT (aka Squidoor) that&#x27;s capable of infecting both Windows and Linux systems. The findings from Symantec mark the first time these two activity clusters have been tied together.
In the attack aimed at the Russian IT service provider, Jewelbug is said to have leveraged a renamed version of Microsoft Console Debugger (&quot;cdb.exe&quot;), which can be used to run shellcode and bypass application allowlisting, as well as launch executables, run DLLs, and terminate security solutions.
The threat actor has also been observed dumping credentials, establishing persistence via scheduled tasks, and attempting to conceal traces of their activity by clearing Windows Event Logs.
The targeting of IT service providers is strategic as it opens the door to possible supply chain attacks, enabling threat actors to leverage the compromise to breach several downstream customers at once through malicious software updates.
Furthermore, Jewelbug has also been linked to an intrusion at a large South American government organization in July 2025, deploying a previously undocumented backdoor that&#x27;s said to be under development – underscoring the group&#x27;s evolving capabilities. The malware uses Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive for command-and-control (C2), and can collect system information, enumerate files from targeted machines, and upload the information to OneDrive.
The use of Microsoft Graph API allows the threat actor to blend in with normal network traffic and leaves minimal forensic artifacts, complicating post-incident analysis and prolonging dwell time for threat actors.
Other targets include an IT provider based in South Asia and a Taiwanese company in October and November 2024, with the attack on the latter leveraging DLL side-loading techniques to drop malicious payloads, including ShadowPad , a backdoor exclusively used by Chinese hacking groups.
The infection chain is also characterized by the deployment of the KillAV tool to disable security software and a publicly available tool named EchoDrv, which permits abuse of the kernel read/write vulnerability in the ECHOAC anti-cheat driver, as part of what appears to be a bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) attack.
Also leveraged were LSASS and Mimikatz for dumping credentials, freely available tools like PrintNotifyPotato, Coerced Potato, and Sweet Potato for discovery and privilege escalation, and a SOCKS tunneling utility dubbed EarthWorm that has been used by Chinese hacking crews like Gelsemium, Lucky Mouse, and Velvet Ant.
The Symantec Threat Hunter Team told The Hacker News that they could not confirm the infection vector used to breach the organizations in all the incidents discussed above.
&quot;Jewelbug&#x27;s preference for using cloud services and other legitimate tools in its operations indicates that remaining under the radar and establishing a stealthy and persistent presence on victim networks is of utmost importance to this group,&quot; Symantec said.

U.S. cybersecurity company F5 on Wednesday disclosed that unidentified threat actors broke into its systems and stole files containing some of BIG-IP&#x27;s source code and information related to undisclosed vulnerabilities in the product.
It attributed the activity to a &quot;highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor,&quot; adding the adversary maintained long-term, persistent access to its network. The company said it learned of the breach on August 9, 2025, per a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). F5 said it delayed the public disclosure at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ).
&quot;We have taken extensive actions to contain the threat actor,&quot; it noted . &quot;Since beginning these activities, we have not seen any new unauthorized activity, and we believe our containment efforts have been successful.&quot;
F5 did not say for how long the threat actors had access to its BIG-IP product development environment, but emphasized that it has not observed any indication that the vulnerabilities have been exploited in a malicious context. It also said that the attackers did not access its CRM, financial, support case management, or iHealth systems.
That said, the company acknowledged that some of the exfiltrated files from its knowledge management platform contained configuration or implementation information for a small percentage of customers. Impacted customers are expected to be directly notified following a review of the files.
Following the discovery of the incident, F5 has engaged the services of Google Mandiant and CrowdStrike, as well as rotated credentials and signing certificates and keys, strengthened access controls, deployed tooling to better monitor threats, bolstered its product development environment with extra security controls, and implemented enhancements to its network security architecture.
Users are advised to apply the latest updates for BIG-IP, F5OS, BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes, BIG-IQ, and APM clients as soon as possible for optimal protection.
CISA Issues Emergency Directive
In response to F5&#x27;s disclosure, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an emergency directive ( ED 26-01 ) that requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to inventory F5 BIG-IP products, check if the networked management interfaces are accessible from the public internet, and apply newly released updates from F5 by October 22, 2025.
&quot;A nation-state affiliated cyber threat actor has compromised F5 systems and exfiltrated data, including portions of the BIG-IP proprietary source code and vulnerability information, which provides the actor with a technical advantage to exploit F5 devices and software,&quot; the agency said . &quot;This poses an imminent threat to federal networks using F5 devices and software.&quot;
&quot;The threat actor&#x27;s access could enable the ability to conduct static and dynamic analysis for identification of logical flaws and zero-day vulnerabilities, as well as the ability to develop targeted exploits.&quot;
CISA is also urging organizations to harden public-facing devices, disconnect those that have reached end-of-life support date, and mitigate against a BIG-IP cookie leakage vulnerability. All agencies are further required to submit a complete inventory of F5 products and actions taken to CISA no later than October 29, 2025, 11:59 p.m. EDT.
In a report published Thursday, Bloomberg revealed that the attackers were in the company&#x27;s network for at least 12 months, and that the intrusion involved the use of a malware family dubbed BRICKSTORM, which is attributed to a China-nexus cyber espionage group tracked as UNC5221.
Last month, Mandiant and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) divulged that companies in the legal services, software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers, Business Process Outsourcers (BPOs), and technology sectors in the U.S. have been targeted by the suspected Chinese hacking group (and other related clusters) to deliver the BRICKSTORM backdoor.
When reached for comment, GTIG/Mandiant told The Hacker News that it does not have anything to share at this stage.
&quot;Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,&quot; Michael Sikorski, CTO and Head of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, said in a statement. &quot;In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch.&quot;
&quot;This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation. The disclosure of 45 vulnerabilities in this quarter vs. just 6 last quarter suggests F5 is moving as fast as they can to actively patch these stolen flaws before the threat actors can exploit them.&quot;

New research has uncovered that publishers of over 100 Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions leaked access tokens that could be exploited by bad actors to update the extensions, posing a critical software supply chain risk.
&quot;A leaked VSCode Marketplace or Open VSX PAT [personal access token] allows an attacker to directly distribute a malicious extension update across the entire install base,&quot; Wiz security researcher Rami McCarthy said in a report shared with The Hacker News. &quot;An attacker who discovered this issue would have been able to directly distribute malware to the cumulative 150,000 install base.&quot;
The cloud security firm noted in many cases publishers failed to account for the fact that VS Code extensions, while distributed as .vsix files, can be unzipped and inspected, exposing hard-coded secrets embedded into them.
In all, Wiz said it found over 550 validated secrets, distributed across more than 500 extensions from hundreds of distinct publishers. The 550 secrets have been found to fall under 67 distinct types of secrets, including -
Wiz also noted in its report that more than 100 extensions leaked VS Code Marketplace PATs, which accounted for over 85,000 installs. Another 30 extensions with a cumulative install base of no less than 100,000 have been found to Open VSX Access Tokens. A significant chunk of the flagged extensions are themes.
With Open VSX also integrated into artificial intelligence (AI)-powered VS Code forks like Cursor and Windsurf, extensions that leak access tokens can significantly expand the attack surface.
In one instance, the company said it identified a VS Code Marketplace PAT that could have allowed for pushing targeted malware to the workforce of a $30 billion market cap Chinese mega corporation, indicating that the problem also extends to internal or vendor-specific extensions used by organizations.
Following responsible disclosure to Microsoft in late March and April 2025, the Windows maker has revoked the leaked PATs and announced it&#x27;s adding secret scanning capabilities to block extensions with verified secrets and notify developers when secrets are detected.
VS Code users are advised to limit the number of installed extensions, scrutinize extensions prior to downloading them, and weigh the pros and cons of enabling auto-updates. Organizations are recommended to develop an extension inventory to better respond to reports of malicious extensions and consider a centralized allowlist for extensions.
&quot;The issue highlights the continued risks of extensions and plugins, and supply chain security in general,&quot; Wiz said. &quot;It continues to validate the impression that any package repository carries a high risk of mass secrets leakage.&quot;
TigerJack Targets VS Code Marketplace with Malicious Extensions
The development comes as Koi Security disclosed details of a threat actor codenamed TigerJack that&#x27;s been attributed to publishing at least 11 legitimate-looking malicious VS Code extensions using various publisher accounts since early 2025 as part of a &quot;coordinated, systematic&quot; campaign.
&quot;Operating under the identities ab-498, 498, and 498-00, Tiger-Jack has deployed a sophisticated arsenal: extensions that steal source code, mine cryptocurrency, and establish remote backdoors for complete system control,&quot; security researcher Tuval Admoni said .
Two of the malicious extensions – C++ Playground and HTTP Format – attracted over 17,000 downloads prior to their takedown . However, they continue to be available on Open VSX, with the threat actor also republishing the same malicious code on September 17, 2025, under new names on the VS Code Marketplace after removal.
What&#x27;s notable about these extensions is that they deliver the promised functionality, which provides the perfect cover for their malicious activities to go unnoticed by unsuspecting developers who may have installed them.
Specifically, the C++ Playground extension has been found to capture keystrokes in almost real-time through a listener that&#x27;s triggered after a 500-millisecond delay. The end goal is to steal C++ source code files. On the other hand, the HTTP Format extension harbors nefarious code to run the CoinIMP miner and stealthily mine cryptocurrency by abusing the system resources.
Three other extensions published by TigerJack under the alias &quot;498,&quot; namely cppplayground, httpformat, and pythonformat, further escalate the risk by incorporating the ability to act as a backdoor by downloading and running arbitrary JavaScript from an external server (&quot;ab498.pythonanywhere[.]com&quot;) every 20 minutes.
&quot;By checking for new instructions every 20 minutes and using eval() on remotely fetched code, TigerJack can dynamically push any malicious payload without updating the extension—stealing credentials and API keys, deploying ransomware, using compromised developer machines as entry points into corporate networks, injecting backdoors into your projects, or monitoring your activity in real-time,&quot; Admoni noted.
Koi Security also pointed out that most of these extensions started off as completely benign tools before the malicious modifications were introduced, a classic case of a Trojan horse approach. This offers several advantages, as it allows the threat actor to establish legitimacy and gain traction among users.
What&#x27;s more, it can also deceive a developer who may have vetted the extension before installation, as the threat actor could push an update later on to compromise their environment.
In June 2025, Microsoft said it has a multi-step process in place to keep the VS Code marketplace free of malware. This includes an initial scan of all incoming packages for malicious run-time behavior in a sandbox environment, as well as rescanning and periodic marketplace-wide scans to &quot;make sure everything stays safe.&quot;
That said, these security protections only apply to VS Code Marketplace, and not others like the Open VSX registry, meaning even if the malicious extension gets removed from Microsoft&#x27;s platform, threat actors can easily migrate to less-secure alternatives.
&quot;The fragmented security landscape across all marketplaces creates dangerous blind spots that sophisticated threat actors are already exploiting,&quot; the company said. &quot;When security operates in silos, threats simply migrate between platforms while developers remain unknowingly exposed.&quot;

"><div class="cell-inner"><div class="cell-content">Over 100 VS Code Extensions Exposed Developers to Hidden Supply Chain Risks
New research has uncovered that publishers of over 100 Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions leaked access tokens that could be exploited by bad actors to update the extensions, posing a critical software supply chain risk.
&quot;A leaked VSCode Marketplace or Open VSX PAT [personal access token] allows an attacker to directly distribute a malicious extension update across the entire install base,&quot; Wiz security researcher Rami McCarthy said in a report shared with The Hacker News. &quot;An attacker who discovered this issue would have been able to directly distribute malware to the cumulative 150,000 install base.&quot;
The cloud security firm noted in many cases publishers failed to account for the fact that VS Code extensions, while distributed as .vsix files, can be unzipped and inspected, exposing hard-coded secrets embedded into them.
In all, Wiz said it found over 550 validated secrets, distributed across more than 500 extensions from hundreds of distinct publishers. The 550 secrets have been found to fall under 67 distinct types of secrets, including -
Wiz also noted in its report that more than 100 extensions leaked VS Code Marketplace PATs, which accounted for over 85,000 installs. Another 30 extensions with a cumulative install base of no less than 100,000 have been found to Open VSX Access Tokens. A significant chunk of the flagged extensions are themes.
With Open VSX also integrated into artificial intelligence (AI)-powered VS Code forks like Cursor and Windsurf, extensions that leak access tokens can significantly expand the attack surface.
In one instance, the company said it identified a VS Code Marketplace PAT that could have allowed for pushing targeted malware to the workforce of a $30 billion market cap Chinese mega corporation, indicating that the problem also extends to internal or vendor-specific extensions used by organizations.
Following responsible disclosure to Microsoft in late March and April 2025, the Windows maker has revoked the leaked PATs and announced it&#x27;s adding secret scanning capabilities to block extensions with verified secrets and notify developers when secrets are detected.
VS Code users are advised to limit the number of installed extensions, scrutinize extensions prior to downloading them, and weigh the pros and cons of enabling auto-updates. Organizations are recommended to develop an extension inventory to better respond to reports of malicious extensions and consider a centralized allowlist for extensions.
&quot;The issue highlights the continued risks of extensions and plugins, and supply chain security in general,&quot; Wiz said. &quot;It continues to validate the impression that any package repository carries a high risk of mass secrets leakage.&quot;

New CoPhish attack steals OAuth tokens via Copilot Studio agents
Bill Toulas

A new phishing technique dubbed &#x27;CoPhish&#x27; weaponizes Microsoft Copilot Studio agents to deliver fraudulent OAuth consent requests via legitimate and trusted Microsoft domains.
The technique was developed by researchers at Datadog Security Labs, who warned in a report earlier this week that Copilot Studio&#x27;s flexibility introduces new, undocumented phishing risks.
Although CoPhish relies on social engineering, Microsoft has confirmed to BleepingComputer that it plans on fixing the underlying causes in a future update.
&quot;We&#x27;ve investigated this report and are taking action to address it through future product updates,&quot; a Microsoft spokesperson told BleepingComputer.
&quot;While this technique relies on social engineering, we remain committed to hardening our governance and consent experiences and are evaluating additional safeguards to help organizations prevent misuse.&quot;
Copilot agents and OAuth phishing
Copilot Studio agents are chatbots hosted on copilotstudio.microsoft.com that users can create and customize through &quot;topics,&quot; which are workflows that automate specific tasks.
Agents can be shared on Microsoft&#x27;s domain by enabling the &quot;demo website&quot; feature. Because the URL is a legitimate one, it is easier for a user to fall for the trick and log in.
The Login topic, which authenticates the user when starting a conversation with the chatbot, can be configured for specific actions, like requesting a verification code or redirecting to another location or service.
Katie Knowles, senior security researcher at Datadog, says that an attacker can customize the Login button with a malicious application that can be &quot;either internal or external to the target environment,&quot; and could target an application admin even they don have access to the environment.
Targeting an unprivileged user in the tenant is currently possible if the threat actor is already present in the environment. However, when Microsoft&#x27;s default policy changes, the attack would be limited only to OneNote read/write permissions and close the gap for email, chat, and calendar services.
Knowles says that even after Microsoft&#x27;s update, it is still possible for an external attacker to &quot;target an Application Administrator with an externally registered application,&quot; because the changes do not apply to high-privileged roles.
Users with administrator privileges in the tenant can approve permissions requested by internal or external applications, even if they are not verified (e.g. are marked as not being published by Microsoft or their organization).
The Datadog researcher says that a CoPhish attack starts with the threat actor creating a malicious multi-tenant app with the sign-in topic configured to direct to the authentication provider and to collect the session token.
Getting the session token is possible by configuring an HTTP request to a Burp Collaborator URL and deliver the access token variable in a &quot;token&quot; header.
&quot;The application ID (or client ID), secret, and authentication provider URLs are used to configure the agent&#x27;s sign-in settings,&quot; Knowles says in a report this week.
It should be noted that the redirect action when the victim user clicks on the Login button can be configured to redirect to any malicious URL, and the application consent workflow URL is just one possibility for the attacker.
CoPhish attack on Admins
After activating the malicious agent&#x27;s demo website, an attacker can distribute it to targets in email phishing campaigns or over Team messages.
Since the URL is legitimate and the design of the page, users may think that it is just another Microsoft Copilot service. Knowles says that one clue that could raise suspicions is the &quot;Microsoft Power Platform&quot; icon, which is easy to miss.
An admin falling for the trick and accepting the malicious app&#x27;s permisssions, are taken to the OAuth redirect URL [token.botframework.com] to validate the bot connection.
&quot;This may seem atypical, but it’s a standard part of the Copilot Studio authentication process using a valid domain,&quot; the Datadog researchers says.
After completing the authentication process, the user will receive no notification about their session token being forwarded to Burp Collaborator and their session being hijacked, but they will be able to chat with the agent.
Furthermore, because the token was sent from Copilot using Microsoft&#x27;s IP addresses, the connection to the attacker will not show in the user&#x27;s web traffic.
Below is a visual overview of how the CoPhish attack works and the steps from the victim user accessing the malicious app to the attacker receiving the token.
Microsoft told BleepingComputer that customers can protect against CoPhish attacks by limiting administrative privileges, reducing application permissions, and enforcing governance policies.
Datadog provides a set of security considerations that include implementing a strong application consent policy that would cover any gaps in Microsoft&#x27;s default baseline configuration.
The cloud monitoring and security company also advises organizations to disable user application creation defaults, and closely monitor application consent via Entra ID and Copilot Studio agent creation events.

Hackers launch mass attacks exploiting outdated WordPress plugins
Bill Toulas

A widespread exploitation campaign is targeting WordPress websites with GutenKit and Hunk Companion plugins vulnerable to critical-severity, old security issues that can be used to achieve remote code execution (RCE).
WordPress security firm Wordfence says that it blocked 8.7 million attack attempts against its customers in just two days, October 8 and 9.
The campaign expoits three flaws, tracked as CVE-2024-9234, CVE-2024-9707, and CVE-2024-11972, all rated critical (CVSS 9.8).
CVE-2024-9234 is an unauthenticated REST-endpoint flaw in the GutenKit plugin with 40,000 installs that allows installing arbitrary plugins without authentication.
CVE-2024-9707 and CVE-2024-11972 are missing-authorization vulnerabilities in the themehunk-import REST endpoint of the Hunk Companion plugin (8,000 installs) which can also lead to installing arbitrary plugins.
An authenticated attacker can leverage the vulnerabilities to introduce another vulnerable plugin that allows remote code execution.
Fixes for the three vulnerabilities became available in Gutenkit 2.1.1, released in October 2024, and Hunk Companion 1.9.0, released in December 2024. However, despite the vendor fixing them almost a year ago, many websites continue to use vulnerable versions.
Wordfence&#x27;s observations based on the attack data indicate that  researchers say that threat actors are hosting on GitHub a malicious plugin in a .ZIP archive called &#x27;up&#x27;.
The archive contains obfuscated scripts that allow uploading, downloading, and deleting files, and changing permissions. One of the scripts that is protected with a password, disguised as a component of the All in One SEO plugin, is used to automatically log in the attacker as an administrator.
The attackers use these tools to maintain persistence, steal or drop files, execute commands, or sniff private data handled by the site.
When attackers cannot directly reach a full admin backdoor via the installed package, they often install the a vulnerable ‘wp-query-console’ plugin that can be leveraged for unauthenticated RCE.
Wordfence has listed several IP addresses that drive high volumes of these malicious requests, which can help create defenses against these attacks.
As an indicator of compromise, the researchers say that administrators should look for /wp-json/gutenkit/v1/install-active-plugin and /wp-json/hc/v1/themehunk-import requests in the site access logs.
They should also check the directories /up , /background-image-cropper , /ultra-seo-processor-wp , /oke , and /wp-query-console , for any rogue entries.
Administrator are recommended to keep all plugins on their websites updated to the latest version available from the vendor.

Critical WSUS flaw in Windows Server now exploited in attacks
Sergiu Gatlan

Attackers are now exploiting a critical-severity Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) vulnerability, which already has publicly available proof-of-concept exploit code.
Tracked as CVE-2025-59287 , this remote code execution (RCE) flaw affects only Windows servers with the WSUS Server role enabled to act as an update source for other WSUS servers within the organization (a feature that isn&#x27;t enabled by default).
Threat actors can exploit this vulnerability remotely in low-complexity attacks that don&#x27;t require privileges or user interaction, allowing them to run malicious code with SYSTEM privileges. Under these conditions, the security flaw could also be potentially wormable between WSUS servers.
On Thursday, Microsoft released out-of-band security updates for all impacted Windows Server versions to &quot;comprehensively address CVE-2025-59287,&quot; and advised IT administrators to install them as soon as possible:
Microsoft also shared workarounds for admins who can&#x27;t immediately deploy the emergency patches, including disabling the WSUS Server role on vulnerable systems to remove the attack vector.
Over the weekend, c ybersecurity firm HawkTrace Security released proof-of-concept exploit code for CVE-2025-59287 that doesn&#x27;t allow arbitrary command execution.
Exploited in the wild
Dutch cybersecurity firm Eye Security reported earlier today that it has already observed scanning and exploitation attempts this morning, with at least one of its customers&#x27; systems compromised using a different exploit than the one shared by Hawktrace over the weekend.
Also, while WSUS servers aren&#x27;t usually exposed online, Eye Security says it found roughly 2,500 instances worldwide, including 250 in Germany and about 100 in the Netherlands.
American cybersecurity company Huntress also found evidence of CVE-2025-59287 attacks targeting WSUS instances with their default ports (8530/TCP and 8531/TCP) exposed online starting Thursday, October 23.
&quot;We expect exploitation of CVE-2025-59287 to be limited; WSUS is not often exposing ports 8530 and 8531. Across our partner base, we have observed ~25 hosts susceptible,&quot; Huntress said .
In the attacks observed by Huntress, the threat actors executed a PowerShell command that performed reconnaissance of the internal Windows domain, which was then sent to a webhook.
This data included the output from the following commands:
The Netherlands National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NL) confirmed the two companies&#x27; findings today, advising admins of the increased risk given that a PoC exploit is already available.
&quot;The NCSC has learned from a trusted partner that exploitation of the vulnerability with identifier CVE-2025-59287 was observed on October 24, 2025,&quot; the NCSC-NL warned in a Friday advisory.
&quot;It is not common practice for a WSUS service to be publicly accessible via the internet. Public proof-of-concept code for the vulnerability is now available, increasing the risk of exploitation.&quot;
Microsoft has classified CVE-2025-59287 as &quot; Exploitation More Likely ,&quot; indicating it is an appealing target for attackers; however, it has not yet updated its advisory to confirm active exploitation.
Update October 24, 13:51 EDT: Added more details on active exploitation from Huntress Labs.

Amazon: This week’s AWS outage caused by major DNS failure
Sergiu Gatlan

Amazon says a major DNS failure was behind a massive AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage that took down many websites and online services on Monday.
As BleepinComputer reported earlier this week , this incident impacted a critical Northern Virginia data center in the US-EAST-1 region, affecting users worldwide, including the United States and Europe, for over 14 hours.
According to a post-mortem published on Thursday, a race condition caused a major DNS failure in Amazon DynamoDB&#x27;s infrastructure, specifically within its DNS management system that controls how user requests are routed to healthy servers, which led to the accidental deletion of all IP addresses for the database service&#x27;s regional endpoint.
&quot;The root cause of this issue was a latent race condition in the DynamoDB DNS management system that resulted in an incorrect empty DNS record for the service&#x27;s regional endpoint (dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com) that the automation failed to repair,&quot; Amazon said.
&quot;When this issue occurred at 11:48 PM PDT, all systems needing to connect to the DynamoDB service in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) Region via the public endpoint immediately began experiencing DNS failures and failed to connect to DynamoDB. This included customer traffic as well as traffic from internal AWS services that rely on DynamoDB.&quot;
The DynamoDB failure triggered cascading problems across AWS infrastructure, leaving DynamoDB&#x27;s DNS system in an inconsistent state that automated recovery couldn&#x27;t fix, requiring manual operator intervention.
Amazon has since disabled the buggy DNS automation globally and taken measures to avoid similar issues, including adding protective checks, improving throttling mechanisms, and building an additional test suite to help detect similar bugs in the future.
&quot;We apologize for the impact this event caused our customers. While we have a strong track record of operating our services with the highest levels of availability, we know how critical our services are to our customers, their applications and end users, and their businesses,&quot; Amazon added.
&quot;We know this event impacted many customers in significant ways. We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further.&quot;

Fake LastPass death claims used to breach password vaults
Bill Toulas

LastPass is warning customers of a phishing campaign sending emails with an access request to the password vault as part of a legacy inheritance process.
The activity started in mid-October, and the domains and infrastructure used point to a financially motivated threat group called CryptoChameleon (UNC5356).
CryptoChamemelon employs a phishing kit specializing in cryptocurrency theft, targeting multiple wallets including Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini, using fake Okta, Gmail, iCloud, and Outlook sign-in pages.
LastPass users were targeted by the same group again in April 2024 , but the newest campaign appears to be more extensive and also enhanced, now targeting passkeys too.
The phishing emails sent to LastPass users claim that a family member requested access to their LastPass vault by uploading a death certificate.
LastPass’s inheritance process is an emergency access feature that allows individuals designated by account holders to request access to their vault in case of death or incapacity.
When such a request is opened, the account holder receives an email, and after a waiting period expires, access is automatically granted to the contact.
The fabricated legacy request includes an agent ID number for added legitimacy, prompting the recipient to take action and cancel it if they are not deceased by clicking a link.
However, the link redirects them to a fraudulent page on lastpassrecovery[.]com that features a login form where the victim can enter their master password.
LastPass says that in some cases the threat actor called victims posing as LastPass staff and directed them to enter their credentials on the phishing site.
The company says that one key element in the CryptoChameleon attack targeting its users is the use of passkey-focused phishing domains such as mypasskey[.]info and passkeysetup[.]com , which indicate attempts to steal users’ passkeys.
Passkeys are a passwordless authentication standard based on the FIDO2 / WebAuthn protocols, using assymmetric cryptography instead of memorized passwords.
Modern password managers like LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane, and Bitwarden now store and sync passkeys across devices, and threat actors have started to target them directly.
In 2022, LastPass suffered a major data breach where attackers stole encrypted vault backups . The incident was linked to targeted attacks that followed, resulting in losses of roughly $4.4 million in cryptocurrency .
Picus Blue Report 2025 is Here: 2X increase in password cracking
46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.

How to reduce costs with self-service password resets
Specops Software

We all need to reset our passwords occasionally, whether it’s due to a simple memory lapse or wider security concerns. However, the process can rack up surprising expenses for organizations. This means self-service password resets (SSPR) aren’t just a ‘nice to have’, they are essential.
Of course, password resets are a part of life for IT teams, according to Gartner, 40% of help desk calls are tied to password expirations, changes and resets. With Forrester estimating that a reset costs $70 , it’s not hard to see how the costs could soon add up.
This is where SSPR comes in. Because it enables users to securely change their own passwords (instead of calling the helpdesk) there could be significant financial savings.
Indeed, a Specops analysis of more than 700 organizations in our customer base found the average user of our uReset SSPR solution saved about $136 per end user. That’s not just a significant saving in a financial sense, but in terms of employee and service desk time too.
To put it simply, if users can reset their own passwords, they can get back to work sooner and service desks can focus elsewhere.

A need for security
However, there can be challenges, so it’s essential to ensure you approach SSPR correctly . In particular, the technology must be secure, to close the door to potential fraudsters and other criminals. For instance, there’s a risk that accounts can be compromised.
You’ll need to watch out for subtle signs of an issue, such as activity you don’t recognise , including password reset messages or changes to security settings.
Bad actors could pursue sim-swapping fraud, where they port a victim’s number onto a rogue SIM to intercept SMS-based two-factor authentication codes and reset the person’s passwords for their own ends, such as accessing social media profiles or bank accounts.
So what’s the answer? A secure and effective system should be built across specified tiers, with different users ranked based on risk, from low to high. Highly critical elements could include the administration credentials for a database containing personally identifiable information, according to the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
Lower-risk, but still important, tiers could include a developer account for a cloud service control panel for a non-production, development sandbox, the NCSC notes.
Password recovery options will need to be matched to an account according to the risk level, ranging from a multi-factor authentication (MFA) tool to involvement by the service desk. Likewise, you will need to ensure proper enrolment hygiene, including the issuing of recovery codes and periodic reverification.
For instance, Specops helps increase defenses against Active Director password attacks with another layer of protection, built on MFA for Windows Logon, RDP and VPN.
Secure your Active Directory passwords with Specops Password Policy
Verizon’s Data Breach Investigation Report found stolen credentials are involved in 44.7% of breaches. Effortlessly secure Active Directory with compliant password policies, blocking 4+ billion compromised passwords, boosting security, and slashing support hassles!
Detecting dangers
A range of approaches can be taken to boost detection of any danger. For instance, rate limiting can be used to limit and monitor the number of requests that a particular user makes in a defined period of time.
Cloud APIs use this approach to ensure that a flow of requests doesn’t overwhelm the service.
Other approaches include:

User experience
Of course, it’s vital to consider the user experience. By using progressive profiling, you can minimize friction, making the collection of relevant data and information as painless as possible.
You could also build telemetry around false rejections, ensuring that you know about any instance where a legitimate user might be denied access.
An A/B test plan can help measure ticket reduction and fraudulent resets, providing evidence you are truly boosting security while saving staff members’ time.
The Specops uReset advantage
Specops uReset is designed to give users the benefits of SSPR , ditching the hassle associated with password resets while boosting security. Users can securely reset their Entra ID or Active Directory passwords from any location, device or browser, making it ideal for remote and hybrid teams.

The system is designed to make life easy for users and IT teams; admins can automatically enrol users, while uReset’s reporting tools keeps you updated on the enrolment process.
The First Day Password add-on also means IT staff never again have to share a first day password with a new hire.
Importantly, the tool helps build security across the business, based on MFA and the use of an end-user verification step that blocks staff from resetting passwords until their identity is confirmed.
Password resets are expensive, but perhaps more importantly, they can waste your staff members’ valuable time. With the right SSPR tools, you can deliver a process that’s smooth, secure and efficient.

Importantly, the tool helps build security across the business, based on MFA and the use of an end-user verification step that blocks staff from resetting passwords until their identity is confirmed.
Password resets are expensive, but perhaps more importantly, they can waste your staff members’ valuable time. With the right SSPR tools, you can deliver a process that’s smooth, secure and efficient.

Mozilla: New Firefox extensions must disclose data collection practices
Sergiu Gatlan

Starting next month, Mozilla will require Firefox extension developers to disclose whether their add-ons collect or share user data with third parties.
The devs will be required to disclose any new extension&#x27;s data practices in the manifest.json file using a dedicated browser_specific_settings.gecko.data_collection_permissions key beginning November 3, 2025. Mozilla will also require all extension developers to adopt this framework in the first half of 2026.
Personally identifiable information that can be obtained through extension APIs or provided by the user includes , but is not limited to, names, email addresses, search terms, and browsing activity data (e.g., domains, URLs, or categories of viewed pages).
Extensions that don&#x27;t collect any personal data must also explicitly state this to ensure complete transparency for users about the data practices they can expect.
This information will appear during the installation prompt, along with any permissions requested. It will also be displayed on the extension&#x27;s listing page on addons.mozilla.org and in the Permissions and Data section of Firefox&#x27;s about:addons management page.
​&quot;Developers can specify what data they wish to collect or transmit in their extensions manifest.json file. This information will be parsed by the browser and shown to the user when they first install the extension,&quot; Mozilla explains .
&quot;A user can then choose to accept or reject the data collection, just like they do with extension permissions. The developer can also specify that the extension collects no data.&quot;
This requirement applies exclusively to newly submitted Firefox extensions. Existing add-ons won&#x27;t need to comply until they update to use the new framework.
However, extensions that fail to properly declare their data collection practices will be blocked from submission to Mozilla&#x27;s add-on repository, and their developers will receive explanatory error messages.
Last month, Mozilla also announced that it will allow Firefox extension devs to roll back to previously approved versions to address critical bugs and issues quickly.
In June, it introduced a security feature for its add-on portal designed to block malicious extensions that drain cryptocurrency wallets.

Windows Server emergency patches fix WSUS bug with PoC exploit
Sergiu Gatlan

Microsoft has released out-of-band (OOB) security updates to patch a critical-severity Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) vulnerability with publicly available proof-of-concept exploit code.
WSUS is a Microsoft product that enables IT administrators to manage and deliver Windows updates to computers within their network.
Tracked as CVE-2025-59287 , this remote code execution (RCE) security flaw affects only Windows servers with the WSUS Server Role enabled, a feature that isn&#x27;t enabled by default.
The vulnerability can be exploited remotely in low-complexity attacks that do not require user interaction, allowing threat actors without privileges to target vulnerable systems and run malicious code with SYSTEM privileges. This makes it potentially wormable between WSUS servers.
&quot;Windows servers that do not have the WSUS server role enabled are not vulnerable to this vulnerability. If the WSUS server role is enabled, the server will become vulnerable if the fix is not installed before the WSUS server role is enabled,&quot; Microsoft explained .
&quot;A remote, unauthenticated attacker could send a crafted event that triggers unsafe object deserialization in a legacy serialization mechanism, resulting in remote code execution.&quot;
Microsoft has released security updates for all impacted Windows Server versions and advised customers to install them as soon as possible:
As Microsoft revealed in a Thursday update to the original security advisory, a CVE-2025-59287 proof-of-concept exploit is now also available online, making it even more critical to patch vulnerable servers immediately.
Microsoft also shared workarounds for admins who can&#x27;t immediately install these emergency patches, including disabling the WSUS Server Role to remove the attack vector or blocking all inbound traffic to Ports 8530 and 8531 on the host firewall to render WSUS non-operational.
However, it&#x27;s important to note that Windows endpoints will stop receiving updates from the local server after WSUS is disabled or the traffic is blocked.
&quot;This is a cumulative update, so you do not need to apply any previous updates before installing this update, as it supersedes all previous updates for affected versions,&quot; Microsoft added.
&quot;If you haven&#x27;t installed the October 2025 Windows security update yet, we recommend you apply this OOB update instead. After you install the update you will need to reboot your system.&quot;
In a separate support document , Microsoft said that WSUS will no longer display synchronization error details after installing these or later updates because this functionality was temporarily removed to address the CVE-2025-59287 RCE vulnerability.
Picus Blue Report 2025 is Here: 2X increase in password cracking
46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.

I dont know if this is clear or not so wanted to add a little more context. When they say worming to other WSUS servers, I dont think that is the worst part. Lots of tools (even MS Config Mgr) uses WSUS for patching 3rd party updates using local publishing with a certificate. If the attacker can become SYSTEM, then they own the box. If that box is an upstream server with a WSUS signing certificate for creating locally published updates, then that certificate is compromised and code could easily be made to publish a malicious update package that WSUS would happily sign. That package could then be assigned to all computers, approved and depending on its slickness, could take out an entire fleet. Something to consider if you are using ConfigMgr or other tools that use WSUS for distributing 3rd party updates from all the vendors that do that sort of thing.

Windows Server emergency patches fix WSUS bug with PoC exploit
Sergiu Gatlan

Microsoft has released out-of-band (OOB) security updates to patch a critical-severity Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) vulnerability with publicly available proof-of-concept exploit code.
WSUS is a Microsoft product that enables IT administrators to manage and deliver Windows updates to computers within their network.
Tracked as CVE-2025-59287 , this remote code execution (RCE) security flaw affects only Windows servers with the WSUS Server Role enabled, a feature that isn&#x27;t enabled by default.
The vulnerability can be exploited remotely in low-complexity attacks that do not require user interaction, allowing threat actors without privileges to target vulnerable systems and run malicious code with SYSTEM privileges. This makes it potentially wormable between WSUS servers.
&quot;Windows servers that do not have the WSUS server role enabled are not vulnerable to this vulnerability. If the WSUS server role is enabled, the server will become vulnerable if the fix is not installed before the WSUS server role is enabled,&quot; Microsoft explained .
&quot;A remote, unauthenticated attacker could send a crafted event that triggers unsafe object deserialization in a legacy serialization mechanism, resulting in remote code execution.&quot;
Microsoft has released security updates for all impacted Windows Server versions and advised customers to install them as soon as possible:
As Microsoft revealed in a Thursday update to the original security advisory, a CVE-2025-59287 proof-of-concept exploit is now also available online, making it even more critical to patch vulnerable servers immediately.
Microsoft also shared workarounds for admins who can&#x27;t immediately install these emergency patches, including disabling the WSUS Server Role to remove the attack vector or blocking all inbound traffic to Ports 8530 and 8531 on the host firewall to render WSUS non-operational.
However, it&#x27;s important to note that Windows endpoints will stop receiving updates from the local server after WSUS is disabled or the traffic is blocked.
&quot;This is a cumulative update, so you do not need to apply any previous updates before installing this update, as it supersedes all previous updates for affected versions,&quot; Microsoft added.
&quot;If you haven&#x27;t installed the October 2025 Windows security update yet, we recommend you apply this OOB update instead. After you install the update you will need to reboot your system.&quot;
In a separate support document , Microsoft said that WSUS will no longer display synchronization error details after installing these or later updates because this functionality was temporarily removed to address the CVE-2025-59287 RCE vulnerability.
Picus Blue Report 2025 is Here: 2X increase in password cracking
46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.

I dont know if this is clear or not so wanted to add a little more context. When they say worming to other WSUS servers, I dont think that is the worst part. Lots of tools (even MS Config Mgr) uses WSUS for patching 3rd party updates using local publishing with a certificate. If the attacker can become SYSTEM, then they own the box. If that box is an upstream server with a WSUS signing certificate for creating locally published updates, then that certificate is compromised and code could easily be made to publish a malicious update package that WSUS would happily sign. That package could then be assigned to all computers, approved and depending on its slickness, could take out an entire fleet. Something to consider if you are using ConfigMgr or other tools that use WSUS for distributing 3rd party updates from all the vendors that do that sort of thing.

Hackers earn $1,024,750 for 73 zero-days at Pwn2Own Ireland
Sergiu Gatlan

​The Pwn2Own Ireland 2025 hacking competition has ended with security researchers collecting $1,024,750 in cash awards after exploiting 73 zero-day vulnerabilities.
At Pwn2Own Ireland 2025, competitors targeted products in eight categories , including printers, network storage systems, messaging apps, smart home devices, surveillance equipment, home networking equipment, flagship smartphones (Apple iPhone 16, Samsung Galaxy S25, and Google Pixel 9), and wearable technology (including Meta&#x27;s Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and Quest 3/3S headsets).
This year&#x27;s contest also expanded the attack surface to include USB port exploitation on mobile handsets, requiring researchers to hack locked devices via a physical connection. However, traditional wireless protocols like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC (near-field communication) remained valid attack vectors.
The hacking contest, co-sponsored by Meta alongside QNAP and Synology, took place from October 21 to October 23 in Cork, Ireland.
Summoning Team won this year&#x27;s edition of Pwn2Own Ireland with 22 Master of Pwn points and $187,500 earned throughout the three-day event after hacking the Samsung Galaxy S25, the Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS, the Home Assistant Green, the Synology ActiveProtect Appliance DP320 NAS drive, the Synology CC400W camera, and the QNAP TS-453E NAS device.
Team ANHTUD secured the second position with $76,750 and 11.5 Master of Pwn points, while Team Synactiv took third place with $90,000 in prizes and 11 Master of Pwn points.
​On the first day of Pwn2Own Ireland, hackers exploited 34 unique zero-days and collected $522,500 in cash awards. On the second day of the event, they demoed another 22 unique zero-day vulnerabilities for $267.500.
The highlight of the last day was the Samsung Galaxy S25 getting hacked by Interrupt Labs&#x27; team via an improper input validation bug, who earned 5 Master of Pwn points and $50,000 after also enabling location tracking and the camera in the process.
While Team Z3 was also scheduled today to demonstrate a WhatsApp Zero-Click remote code execution zero-day, eligible for a $1 million reward , they withdrew from the competition . They chose to disclose their findings privately to ZDI analysts before sharing their research with Meta&#x27;s engineering team.
The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) organizes this hacking contest to identify security vulnerabilities before threat actors can exploit them in attacks and coordinate responsible disclosure with the affected vendors.
After the zero-days are exploited at Pwn2Own, the vendors have 90 days to release patches before Trend Micro&#x27;s Zero Day Initiative publicly discloses them.
In January 2026, the ZDI will once again be at the Automotive World technology show in Tokyo, Japan, for the third Pwn2Own Automotive contest , again sponsored by Tesla

Toys “R” Us Canada warns customers&#x27; info leaked in data breach
Bill Toulas

Toys “R” Us Canada has sent notices of a data breach to customers informing them of a security incident where threat actors leaked customer records they had previously stolen from its systems.
The company discovered the data leak on July 30, 2025, when a threat actor posted on the dark web what they claimed to be Toys “R” Us customer data.
Subsequent investigation of the threat actor’s claims, conducted with the help of third-party experts, confirmed that the information was indeed authentic.
“On July 30, 2025, we became aware via a posting on the unindexed internet that a third-party was claiming to have stolen information from our database,” reads the letter sent to customers .
“We immediately hired third-party cybersecurity experts to assist with containment and to investigate the incident.”
“The investigation revealed that the unauthorized third party copied certain records form our customer database which contains personal information.”
The data types that were leaked vary per individual, and may contain one or more of the following:
Toys “R” Us underlines that account passwords, credit card information, or other “similar confidential data” were not exposed.

Toys “R” Us Canada warns customers&#x27; info leaked in data breach
Bill Toulas

Toys “R” Us Canada has sent notices of a data breach to customers informing them of a security incident where threat actors leaked customer records they had previously stolen from its systems.
The company discovered the data leak on July 30, 2025, when a threat actor posted on the dark web what they claimed to be Toys “R” Us customer data.
Subsequent investigation of the threat actor’s claims, conducted with the help of third-party experts, confirmed that the information was indeed authentic.
“On July 30, 2025, we became aware via a posting on the unindexed internet that a third-party was claiming to have stolen information from our database,” reads the letter sent to customers .
“We immediately hired third-party cybersecurity experts to assist with containment and to investigate the incident.”
“The investigation revealed that the unauthorized third party copied certain records form our customer database which contains personal information.”
The data types that were leaked vary per individual, and may contain one or more of the following:
Toys “R” Us underlines that account passwords, credit card information, or other “similar confidential data” were not exposed.

HP pulls update that broke Microsoft Entra ID auth on some AI PCs
Lawrence Abrams

HP has pulled an HP OneAgent software update for Windows 11 that mistakenly deleted Microsoft certificates required for some organizations to log in to Microsoft Entra ID, disconnecting them from their company&#x27;s cloud environments.
The bug was discovered by Patch My PC&#x27;s Rudy Ooms, who traced it to a silent, background update deployed by HP to its AI PC devices.
According to Ooms, systems that installed the HP OneAgent version 1.2.50.9581 automatically executed a cleanup package named SP161710. The package included an install.cmd script that was designed to remove any remnants of HP&#x27;s 1E Performance Assist software.
One of the subroutines in this script would search for and delete any certificate containing the &quot;1E&quot; substring in its subject, issuer, or friendly name. However, a script like this is risky as it could lead to false positives and delete certificates it was not designed to target.
When a device joins Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) or Intune, Microsoft issues a &quot;MS-Organization-Access&quot; certificate specific to an organization&#x27;s tenant. This certificate is stored in the Windows certificate store and is now required to properly authenticate against Entra ID.
For a subset of users, Ooms said their &quot;MS-Organization-Access&quot; certificate had a thumbprint containing the &quot;1E&quot; substring, which caused HP&#x27;s cleanup script to delete the certificate.
Once the certificates were removed, devices immediately disconnect from Entra ID and could no longer log in with their credentials.
&quot;The whole Entra/Azure AD Join was gone!,&quot; explains Ooms. &quot;With it, the devices had silently fallen out of the cloud. The whole trust between Windows and Entra ID disappeared.&quot;
Ooms confirmed from the logs that the OneAgent&#x27;s update instructions came directly from HP&#x27;s AWS IoT infrastructure.
Limited impact
Ooms says that because each organization receives a unique certificate, there is only a 9.3% chance that certificates contain the &quot;1E&quot; chain in the Subject field. As the cleanup script was only pushed out to HP AI PCs, the impact is likely even smaller.
Furthermore, while the faulty script&#x27;s most visible effect was on Microsoft Entra ID authentication, it may also have removed other legitimate certificates used by different platforms.
In a statement to BleepingComputer, HP confirmed that it had pulled the problematic update and stated that it is assisting impacted customers.
&quot;HP is aware of a potential issue affecting some HP AI PCs related to a recent over the air update,&quot; HP told BleepingComputer. &quot;The update is no longer available and will not affect more AI PCs. We&#x27;re investigating the issue and working closely with impacted customers on mitigation.&quot;
Ooms says that those devices that are impacted by the faulty script now require a manual recovery process to be able to rejoin the domain, and shared the following steps for those with local access to the device:
Ooms&#x27; article also describes an additional method for remotely fixing a device using Microsoft Defender&#x27;s Live Response feature.

Wow.  Sloppy coding. This is the kind of script I may write as a one-off when I know all the inputs. This WILL have deleted other certs. The ones related to Entra may have been the most obvious ones.

Meet the new Clippy: Microsoft unveils Copilot&#x27;s &quot;Mico&quot; avatar
Sergiu Gatlan

Today, Microsoft introduced Mico, a new and more personal avatar for the AI-powered Copilot digital assistant, which the company describes as human-centered.
This new avatar is designed to be more supportive and empathetic, but will also push back when presented with incorrect information, &quot;always respectfully.&quot;
According to Microsoft, Mico also listens, learns, and &quot;earns your trust,&quot; unlike the heavily parodied and criticized Clippy , the default Microsoft Office assistant for four years, or the Cortana Windows digital assistant, which Copilot replaced in September 2023.
&quot;This optional visual presence listens, reacts, and even changes colors to reflect your interactions, making voice conversations feel more natural. Mico shows support through animation and expressions, creating a friendly and engaging experience,&quot; Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said in a Thursday blog post .
&quot;Separately, explore conversation styles like real talk, which offers a collaborative model that challenges assumptions with care, adapts to your vibe, and helps conversations spark growth and connection.&quot;
On Thursday, Suleyman also announced that the Copilot Fall Release introduces Copilot Groups , which allows up to 32 people to collaborate in real time within the same Copilot session.
Copilot now also has long-term memory, enabling users to keep track of their thoughts and to-do lists, while the Memory &amp; Personalization feature allows it to remember important details, such as appointments or anniversaries, for future interactions.
The Deep Research Proactive Actions capability helps Copilot provide timely insights and suggest next steps based on your recent activities, and a new Learn Live feature will transform Copilot into a voice-enabled tutor that guides you through concepts using &quot;questions, visual cues, and interactive whiteboards.&quot;
Mico and the other new Copilot features introduced today are available for users in the United States. They are expected to roll out to more regions, such as Canada and the UK, over the coming weeks.
One week ago, Microsoft rolled out the &quot;Hey Copilot&quot; wake word , an opt-in feature that allows users to talk to their Windows 11 computers, and also announced that Copilot can now generate Office documents and connect to Microsoft and third-party accounts, such as Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar.
As part of the same effort to expand Copilot&#x27;s reach to more customers, Redmond enabled the Gaming Copilot &quot;personal gaming sidekick&quot; on Windows 11 PCs for users aged 18 or older and rolled out the content-aware Copilot Chat to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote for paying Microsoft 365 business customers.

46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.

Microsoft Issues Emergency Patch for Critical Windows Server Bug Microsoft Issues Emergency Patch for Critical Windows Server Bug Microsoft Issues Emergency Patch for Critical Windows Server Bug
Microsoft initially fixed CVE-2025-59287 in the WSUS update mechanism in the October 2025 Patch Tuesday release, but the company has now issued a second, out-of-band update for the flaw, which is under attack in the wild.
October 24, 2025
UPDATE
Microsoft on Thursday deployed a reworked update for a critical vulnerability in the Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) that has come under attack in the wild.
CVE-2025-59287 is a remote code execution (RCE) flaw in WSUS , which is part of Windows Server and allows administrators to schedule, manage, and deploy patches, hotfixes, service packs, and other updates. The vulnerability received an initial patch in Microsoft&#x27;s October Patch Tuesday release, but the company issued another emergency patch &quot;to comprehensively address CVE-2025-59287.&quot;
The vulnerability, which received a 9.8 CVSS score, enables attackers to trigger &quot;unsafe object deserialization in a legacy serialization mechanism&quot; and remotely execute code on vulnerable systems, according to Microsoft&#x27;s advisory . Worryingly, several cybersecurity companies on Friday warned that exploitation activity for CVE-2025-59287 was now underway.
&quot;We expect more attacker activity for this vulnerability to hit CISA KEV very soon, as more organizations are being affected,&quot; Horizon3 researchers said in a post on X today. And in a blog post on Friday, Huntress researchers said they observed exploitation activity beginning on Thursday, with threat actors targeting WSUS instances that are publicly exposed on their default ports, 8530 and 8531.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added CVE-2025-59287 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog Friday afternoon.
Microsoft Takes a Second Crack at CVE-2025-59287
Last week, cybersecurity firm Hawktrace published a technical analysis of the flaw with a proof of concept (PoC) exploit. Hawktrace security researcher Batuhan Er explained at the time that the vulnerability stems from AuthorizationCookie objects sent to the GetCookie() endpoint, which are deserialized by BinaryFormatter without proper type validation.
&quot;Permanent mitigation requires replacing BinaryFormatter with secure serialization mechanisms, implementing strict type validation, and enforcing proper input sanitization on all cookie data,&quot; Er wrote.
Microsoft confirmed to Dark Reading that the initial patch for CVE-2025-59287 was incomplete. &quot;We rereleased this CVE after identifying that the initial update did not fully mitigate the issue. Customers who have installed the latest updates are already protected,&quot; a Microsoft spokesperson says, though they did not comment further.
It&#x27;s unclear where the initial patch for CVE-2025-59287 fell short. The updated advisory doesn&#x27;t specify any differences between the original patch and the emergency update.
Related: Pwn2Own Underscores Secure Development Concerns
Microsoft&#x27;s advisory noted that for the vulnerability to be exploited, the WSUS Server Role must be enabled. The role is not enabled by default of Windows Server, and organizations that have enabled the WSUS Server Role can disable it as a temporary mitigation. The company also recommended blocking inbound traffic to ports 8530 and 8531 on their host firewalls.
This story was updated at 4:45 p.m. ET on Oct. 24 to reflect that CISA added CVE-2025-59287 to its KEV catalog.

How CISA Layoffs Weaken Civilian Cyber Defense How CISA Layoffs Weaken Civilian Cyber Defense How CISA Layoffs Weaken Civilian Cyber Defense
Cyber teams need to get to work backfilling diminishing federal resources, according to Alexander Garcia-Tobar, who shares clear steps on a path forward for protecting enterprises with less CISA help.
October 24, 2025
COMMENTARY
The recent layoffs at CISA landed at the worst possible moment for the country&#x27;s digital defense. CISA isn&#x27;t simply another Washington bureaucracy, it&#x27;s the nerve center that connects government, industry, and critical defense infrastructure in a shared defense network. When that coordination slows, every organization that depends on timely threat intelligence is left incrementally a little more exposed.
Since its creation in 2018, CISA has been the quarterback of America&#x27;s civilian cyber defense, ensuring that both the public and private sectors could act from a common playbook. Reducing that capacity is like shutting down air traffic control in bad weather — planes can still fly, but they&#x27;re relying on luck and local radar.
We&#x27;re entering an era defined by three converging pressures. First, cybercrime is scaling faster than ever. Global attacks surged 40% this year, with losses projected to exceed $10 trillion by 2029. Second, AI has supercharged attackers — enabling cheap, human-sounding phishing, deep-fake impersonation, and faster reconnaissance. And third, our federal cyber infrastructure is shrinking just as adversaries have started to accelerate.
The consequences extend beyond federal networks. Fewer analysts and responders mean slower cross-sector alerts, thinner intelligence pipelines, and more uncertainty for enterprises already juggling risk. In that vacuum, adversaries will exploit confusion.

Cyber Pros Need to Fill the Federal Leadership Vacuum
It&#x27;s up to private cybersecurity teams to pick up the slack. And there are several practical steps that private sector organization cyber leaders can take immediately.
Join a sector‑based or cross‑industry threat intelligence sharing group. The National Council of ISACs (NCI) — the umbrella body for 28 ISACs that collect and share actionable data is a good place to start. If your industry lacks coverage, form or join an Information Sharing and Analysis (ISAO) to coordinate cyber-risk information among peers.
Cybersecurity pros can also leverage existing private‑sector platforms such as the Open Threat Exchange (OTX) or participate in membership/partnerships like the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS‑ISAC).
Further, it&#x27;s wise to ensure an internal process is in place to ingest threat data and act on it — not just receive feeds. Standards like National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800‑150 outline how to integrate internal and external threat intelligence.
Related: Electronic Warfare Puts Commercial GPS Users on Notice
It might also be necessary to increase investment to compensate for reduced government support, including ramping up internal threat detection and monitoring tools (especially for fast‑moving threats like AI‑enabled phishing).
Workforce training and awareness is another area where enterprises might find it valuable to boost spending as well, especially in business email compromise (BEC) and AI‑driven threat vectors.
A retreating federal presence in the cybersecurity sector might also signal that it&#x27;s time for cybersecurity teams to refocus resources on zero‑trust architecture, supply chain security, and email authentication (DMARC, SPF, DKIM) to reduce the attack surface.
Individual industries also need to seek opportunities to strengthen private‑public partnership by serving as proactive partners. Even if CISA&#x27;s role is diminished, companies can journal and publish incident summaries, share anonymized attack data, join cross‑industry working groups, and host tabletop exercises.
Risk and governance should also get increased attention. With weaker federal oversight and support, organizations should adopt more mature risk governance by increasing board awareness of cyber-risk metrics and third‑party risk, and work to bake cybersecurity into business strategy rather than treat it as an &quot;IT problem.&quot;

Fundamentally, a layered implementation is the most effective and proven approach. Resilience means diversity — of systems, vendors, and thinking. If one vendor fails, the other still works; if one is breached, the other is still in place. A layered approach, combining zero-trust principles, authentication, and AI-based defenses, is much more effective. This is especially important as the industry continues to embrace AI. AI is an important tool in our toolkit, but it can&#x27;t be the only technology we rely on. Layering is the essence of resilience.
Immediate Action Items
Educate your board and senior management on the weakened federal defenses and cuts to justify the importance of immediately increasing vigilance and need for additional budgeting.
Apply the 80/20 rule to cover the most likely attacks with the most efficient approaches.
Apply MFA and passkeys to as many processes as possible.
Biometric integration to MFA are AI resistant; encourage their use.
Email is the front door to attacks — lock it down with DMARC at enforcement.
Apply a zero-trust approach to your network and supply chain.
Establish a CIRT (Cyber Incident Response Team) or ensure it&#x27;s properly funded; and run regular scenario drills (e.g., AI‑phishing takeover, vendor compromise).
Subscribe to and actively monitor threat feeds (from ISAC/ISAO, vendor intelligence or open source) and ensure your SOC/IR teams have mechanisms to convert intelligence into detection rules, blocking/mitigation workflows.
Align with a peer network (via ISAC/ISAO) to share anonymized incidents and best‑practice playbooks — collaboration becomes more important when federal coordination is weakened.
Cybersecurity has also always depended on continuity — of policy, of personnel, and of partnership. Sudden budget cuts, leadership changes, and dissolved review boards fracture that continuity and erode trust. Adversaries thrive on uncertainty, defenders need stability.
Attackers won&#x27;t wait for federal leadership to be restored. Neither should we.

Shutdown Sparks 85% Increase in US Government Cyberattacks Shutdown Sparks 85% Increase in US Government Cyberattacks Shutdown Sparks 85% Increase in US Government Cyberattacks
Attackers are pouncing on financially strapped US government agencies and furloughed employees. And the effects of this period might be felt for a long time hereafter.
October 24, 2025
Cyberattacks against federal employees have nearly doubled since the US government shut down on Oct. 1.
With vital agencies on pause, employees furloughed, and threat activity only ever rising, the federal government and its personnel have possibly never been weaker than they are right now, from a cybersecurity perspective. Predictably, threat actors have noticed. The month of October has seen a surge of meaningful attacks against government workers in limbo, with potential consequences for the agencies that employ them and, by extension, the nation they oversee.
Experts emphasize, too, that the most serious cyber consequences of the shutdown won&#x27;t come in the form of immediate breaches. Threat actors targeting employees today might lie in wait until some future day. Add to that all of the recruiting challenges and eroding trust in government institutions and it&#x27;s the long-term fallout that should worry everyone most.
555M Government Cyberattacks in One Month
Cyberattacks against US agencies were rising steadily even before Oct. 1, in anticipation of the shutdown. Researchers at the Media Trust then observed a spike of activity on its very first day.
At this point, they&#x27;re projecting that the feds will experience north of 555 million cyberattacks by the end of the month — an 85% increase over the already more active than usual month of September.
Related: How CISA Layoffs Weaken Civilian Cyber Defense
Source: The Media Trust
To make matters worse, Media Trust CEO Chris Olson points out that those 555 million attacks aren&#x27;t the cheap phishing chum one might expect to dominate such a dataset.
&quot;These are targeted digital attacks through websites, apps, and targeted advertising. What we are detecting are actual interactions with employees,&quot; he says.
Government Employees Are at Their Most Vulnerable
Justin Miller, associate professor of cyber studies at the University of Tulsa, knows well the kinds of financial hardships government employees face during shutdowns, having spent decades with the Secret Service.
&quot;I remember last time, the DHS said, &#x27;Hey, give this to your mortgage company. It&#x27;s a letter saying you&#x27;re a Homeland Security employee, in case you can&#x27;t pay your mortgage.&#x27; And my mortgage company laughed at me. They&#x27;re like, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s great. I can appreciate your work for DHS, but your mortgage is due on the 15th and you need to pay it,&#x27;&quot; he recalls.
Financially stressed employees are exactly the targets attackers are aiming for. Elaborating on his data, the Media Trust&#x27;s Olson reports that nation-state actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists are performing &quot;a surge in deceptive ad campaigns and phishing lures designed to exploit financial anxiety during the government shutdown. Many of these spam campaigns promise quick cash, loan forgiveness, or job opportunities but lead to credential-harvesting sites or malware downloads.&quot;
Related: Electronic Warfare Puts Commercial GPS Users on Notice
An attack on a government employee sitting at home today could be utilized later, once that employee goes back to work. An attacker could learn about that employee in order to impersonate them later in phishing emails, or infiltrate the smartphone they&#x27;ll bring to work again every day once the shutdown lifts.
Or attackers can do one better.
The Risk to Essential Employees
The Media Trust found that the most targeted agency during this shutdown, by far, has been the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In second place — again, some distance from third — is the Department of Justice (DoJ). The chart below shows the volume of attacks that reached each agency in the first week of October.
Though the VA and DoJ might sound like an arbitrary duo, there may well be some hidden logic underneath.
Source: The Media Trust
When a government shutdown happens, employees fall into two buckets. Many are furloughed — sent home and barred from even checking their government email inbox. Some are deemed &quot;essential,&quot; though, and they have to keep working.
Related: International Sting Takes Down SIM Box Criminal Network
Essential workers are just as unpaid, stressed, and vulnerable, yet they still have to walk into their workplace everyday. Miller points out how, especially in these cases, &quot;you&#x27;re going to have morale issues. And then with this minimal staffing, you&#x27;re creating a higher burden on the personnel who are there having to do probably additional work,&quot; meaning cyber threats are more likely to slip through.
Because so many of them perform crucial medical and benefits work, 96.8% of employees at the VA are still going into work Monday through Friday. Similarly, 90% of DoJ employees are considered essential .
The White House has advised that, during the shutdown, &quot;generally, agency cybersecurity functions are excepted as these functions are necessary to avoid imminent threat to Federal property,&quot; but agencies have discretion in how they interpret this guideline. And with two-thirds of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sitting at home , agencies already lack the support they&#x27;re used to at a time when they&#x27;re at greatest risk.
The Long-Term Fallout
Ilona Cohen, former general counsel for the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB), now chief legal and policy officer for HackerOne, worries that amid all the headlines, people might be missing the forest for the trees.
&quot;I think people think, &#x27;OK, a certain amount of damage will be done in a certain number of days, whatever. Congress and the president decide [it&#x27;s over] and then we all go back to business.&#x27; But there is a long-term impact anytime you have a shutdown like this,&quot; she says.
Putting aside the threat of latent cyberattacks — like the 2015 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach — there are also less visible consequences. For example, the government already faces an uphill battle recruiting talent from the more lucrative private sector, which is only set to grow worse now.
&quot;It is a challenge that has been difficult to address for years now and there has been some progress. But if you are constantly having federal workers who are nervous about instability in the federal government and a failure to be paid, then you&#x27;re just going to push skilled cyber professionals out of public service. That&#x27;s going to be a problem not just when the shutdown ends, but for many, many weeks, months, years, depending on how many people you lose because of this instability,&quot; Cohen says.
Then there are all of the difficulties that come with discontinuity — paused projects, delayed modernization of legacy systems, and vulnerabilities going unaddressed.
Combine that with the expiration of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015) and the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP), &quot;and the combination of the shutdown plus the expiration of critical laws means that you have a significant erosion of trust,&quot; Cohen says. &quot;It just breaks down.&quot;

Shutdown Sparks 85% Increase in US Government Cyberattacks Shutdown Sparks 85% Increase in US Government Cyberattacks Shutdown Sparks 85% Increase in US Government Cyberattacks
Attackers are pouncing on financially strapped US government agencies and furloughed employees. And the effects of this period might be felt for a long time hereafter.
October 24, 2025
Cyberattacks against federal employees have nearly doubled since the US government shut down on Oct. 1.
With vital agencies on pause, employees furloughed, and threat activity only ever rising, the federal government and its personnel have possibly never been weaker than they are right now, from a cybersecurity perspective. Predictably, threat actors have noticed. The month of October has seen a surge of meaningful attacks against government workers in limbo, with potential consequences for the agencies that employ them and, by extension, the nation they oversee.
Experts emphasize, too, that the most serious cyber consequences of the shutdown won&#x27;t come in the form of immediate breaches. Threat actors targeting employees today might lie in wait until some future day. Add to that all of the recruiting challenges and eroding trust in government institutions and it&#x27;s the long-term fallout that should worry everyone most.
555M Government Cyberattacks in One Month
Cyberattacks against US agencies were rising steadily even before Oct. 1, in anticipation of the shutdown. Researchers at the Media Trust then observed a spike of activity on its very first day.
At this point, they&#x27;re projecting that the feds will experience north of 555 million cyberattacks by the end of the month — an 85% increase over the already more active than usual month of September.

To make matters worse, Media Trust CEO Chris Olson points out that those 555 million attacks aren&#x27;t the cheap phishing chum one might expect to dominate such a dataset.
&quot;These are targeted digital attacks through websites, apps, and targeted advertising. What we are detecting are actual interactions with employees,&quot; he says.
Government Employees Are at Their Most Vulnerable
Justin Miller, associate professor of cyber studies at the University of Tulsa, knows well the kinds of financial hardships government employees face during shutdowns, having spent decades with the Secret Service.
&quot;I remember last time, the DHS said, &#x27;Hey, give this to your mortgage company. It&#x27;s a letter saying you&#x27;re a Homeland Security employee, in case you can&#x27;t pay your mortgage.&#x27; And my mortgage company laughed at me. They&#x27;re like, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s great. I can appreciate your work for DHS, but your mortgage is due on the 15th and you need to pay it,&#x27;&quot; he recalls.
Financially stressed employees are exactly the targets attackers are aiming for. Elaborating on his data, the Media Trust&#x27;s Olson reports that nation-state actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists are performing &quot;a surge in deceptive ad campaigns and phishing lures designed to exploit financial anxiety during the government shutdown. Many of these spam campaigns promise quick cash, loan forgiveness, or job opportunities but lead to credential-harvesting sites or malware downloads.&quot;

An attack on a government employee sitting at home today could be utilized later, once that employee goes back to work. An attacker could learn about that employee in order to impersonate them later in phishing emails, or infiltrate the smartphone they&#x27;ll bring to work again every day once the shutdown lifts.
Or attackers can do one better.
The Risk to Essential Employees
The Media Trust found that the most targeted agency during this shutdown, by far, has been the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In second place — again, some distance from third — is the Department of Justice (DoJ). The chart below shows the volume of attacks that reached each agency in the first week of October.
Though the VA and DoJ might sound like an arbitrary duo, there may well be some hidden logic underneath.
Source: The Media Trust
When a government shutdown happens, employees fall into two buckets. Many are furloughed — sent home and barred from even checking their government email inbox. Some are deemed &quot;essential,&quot; though, and they have to keep working.
Related: International Sting Takes Down SIM Box Criminal Network
Essential workers are just as unpaid, stressed, and vulnerable, yet they still have to walk into their workplace everyday. Miller points out how, especially in these cases, &quot;you&#x27;re going to have morale issues. And then with this minimal staffing, you&#x27;re creating a higher burden on the personnel who are there having to do probably additional work,&quot; meaning cyber threats are more likely to slip through.
Because so many of them perform crucial medical and benefits work, 96.8% of employees at the VA are still going into work Monday through Friday. Similarly, 90% of DoJ employees are considered essential .
The White House has advised that, during the shutdown, &quot;generally, agency cybersecurity functions are excepted as these functions are necessary to avoid imminent threat to Federal property,&quot; but agencies have discretion in how they interpret this guideline. And with two-thirds of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sitting at home , agencies already lack the support they&#x27;re used to at a time when they&#x27;re at greatest risk.
The Long-Term Fallout
Ilona Cohen, former general counsel for the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB), now chief legal and policy officer for HackerOne, worries that amid all the headlines, people might be missing the forest for the trees.
&quot;I think people think, &#x27;OK, a certain amount of damage will be done in a certain number of days, whatever. Congress and the president decide [it&#x27;s over] and then we all go back to business.&#x27; But there is a long-term impact anytime you have a shutdown like this,&quot; she says.

US Crypto Bust Offers Hope in Battle Against Cybercrime Syndicates US Crypto Bust Offers Hope in Battle Against Cybercrime Syndicates US Crypto Bust Offers Hope in Battle Against Cybercrime Syndicates
A $14 billion seizure by US investigators presents a warning for cybercriminals&#x27; reliance on bitcoin but is still a positive development for the cryptocurrency industry.
October 24, 2025
A massive seizure by the US government of cryptocurrency from a sprawling Southeast Asia cybercrime syndicate has raised hopes that coordinated actions against cybercriminal groups can help undermine their profits.
On Oct. 14, the US Department of Justice — along with the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of State, and other agencies — announced the seizure of 127,271 bitcoin kept in &quot;unhosted wallets&quot; and the indictment of Chen Zhi, the founder and chairman of the Prince Holding Group, on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. The seized bitcoin, stored in 25 wallets, are worth more than $14 billion, and were valued at nearly $15 billion on the day of the announcement.
Calling the Prince Group umbrella of companies &quot;a criminal enterprise built on human suffering,&quot; US officials positioned the indictment and forfeiture one of the most significant strikes against cyber-enabled financial fraud and human trafficking.
&quot;This investigation exposes a staggering level of fraud, corruption, and criminal greed that allowed billions of dollars in illicit funds to flow through global financial systems, leaving behind a trail of victims,&quot; Frank A. Tarentino III, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration&#x27;s New York Division, said in a statement regarding the seizure . &quot;It also highlights how transnational criminal organizations continue to evolve, leveraging cryptocurrency and other digital assets to move their money and mask their crimes.&quot;
Related: Lazarus Group Hunts European Drone Manufacturing Data
The seizure could create significant ripples in the cybercrime economy in Southeast Asia. Blockchain watchers have estimated that illicit entities presently hold about $15 billion in wallets , mainly due to stolen funds being funneled into cryptocurrency. Another $60 billion is held by a variety of services that sell illicit goods and services, such as Dark Web markets, online pharmacies, fraud shops, and terrorist financing, according to data from Chainalysis .
Cybercriminal syndicates in Burma, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand stole more than $10 billion from US citizens in 2024 and likely harvest tens of billions of dollars every year from victims, according to estimates .
The seizure, which represents only 0.6% of the 19.9 million existing bitcoins, is a positive development both for law enforcement and for the cryptocurrency industry, says Ari Redbord, a former senior US Treasury official and now global head of policy and government affairs for TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence platform.
&quot;While it&#x27;s a record-breaking forfeiture, the direct market impact will be limited,&quot; he says. &quot;The real significance is what it signals: that even large, static hoards held in unhosted wallets can ultimately be traced and recovered. For criminals, that&#x27;s a chilling precedent. For the ecosystem, it&#x27;s proof that transparency and persistence work.&quot;

Money Laundering at Scale
The Prince Group is a major organization running cybercriminal enterprises in Southeast Asia, with its central operations in Cambodia and hubs and shell companies in British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, Laos, Palau, and Singapore, according to the US Treasury Department . Using a front as a real estate and investment conglomerate, the Prince Group and its associated organizations operated bitcoin mining operations and 10 forced-labor camps across Cambodia, which ran investment and romance scams. The workers in those camps were imprisoned, often tortured, and trafficked amongst compounds .

The Prince Group and its associates used complicated cryptocurrency laundering techniques to repeatedly split apart transactions — called &quot;spraying&quot; or &quot;fragmentation&quot; — and then consolidated the funds into a small number of wallets — known as &quot;funneling&quot; and &quot;integration&quot; — under the control of the chairman, Chen Zhi, and his lieutenants, according to the US Department of Justice indictment.

Many cybercriminal groups have moved away from cryptocurrencies — such as stable coins, which can be frozen by centralized issuers — and into bitcoin because of its attribute of &quot;self custody,&quot; which allows the cryptographic keys that represent the funds to be moved into offline storage or &quot;cold wallets.&quot;
According to the DOJ filing, the 127,271 bitcoins were held in unhosted cryptocurrency wallets whose private keys were personally held by the Chen. The US government ability to investigate the cybercriminal groups and seize a significant amount of bitcoin is a significant win, according to blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic.
&quot;While the transnational organized crime groups behind these scams often appear to operate with impunity, the actions taken show this is clearly not the case,&quot; Elliptic stated in response to questions from Dark Reading. &quot;The detailed indictment and information released highlight that governments have been closely tracking the issue for some time. Continued action like this would be widely welcomed and represents an important step in addressing this significant and growing global threat.&quot;
Long Game Is &#x27;Hard to Pull Off&#x27;
Repeating the win will be difficult, however.
While the US Department of Justice and government officials announced the seizure and indictment on Oct. 14, the actual investigation and enforcement actions occurred last year and the investigation took much longer. The seizure of the funds likely took place in June and July of 2024, when the wallets holding the bitcoin &quot;suddenly lit up ... suggesting coordinate[d] enforcement activity,&quot; says TRM Labs&#x27; Redboard.
&quot;These operations are exceptionally hard to pull off,&quot; he says. &quot;They require cooperation across agencies and borders, and — critically — access to private keys. Investigators can map transactions forever, but they can&#x27;t move assets without those keys. The fact that the US was able to gain control here means that digital and physical evidence aligned, resulting in a great outcome.&quot;
The successful seizure may also reverse a trend that blockchain experts have noted: Cybercriminals&#x27; increasing dependency on bitcoin. While other cryptocurrencies exist — and stable coin has become popular among some investors — bitcoin&#x27;s self-custody attribute has been seen as a significant benefit, says Eric Jardine, cybercrimes research manager at Chainalysis, a crypto intelligence firm.
&quot;There&#x27;s a growing amount of evidence to suggest that illicit actors are just outright comfortable storing value in bitcoin,&quot; he says. &quot;Unlike stable coins, which could be frozen for example, you can basically sit on [bitcoin] for however long you like and then send it wherever you want, and no one&#x27;s going to be able to stop you.&quot;
Yet, as the Prince Group found, such attributes have a downside as well. Whether the seizure by the US government results in a movement away from bitcoin remains to be seen.

Many cybercriminal groups have moved away from cryptocurrencies — such as stable coins, which can be frozen by centralized issuers — and into bitcoin because of its attribute of &quot;self custody,&quot; which allows the cryptographic keys that represent the funds to be moved into offline storage or &quot;cold wallets.&quot;
According to the DOJ filing, the 127,271 bitcoins were held in unhosted cryptocurrency wallets whose private keys were personally held by the Chen. The US government ability to investigate the cybercriminal groups and seize a significant amount of bitcoin is a significant win, according to blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic.
&quot;While the transnational organized crime groups behind these scams often appear to operate with impunity, the actions taken show this is clearly not the case,&quot; Elliptic stated in response to questions from Dark Reading. &quot;The detailed indictment and information released highlight that governments have been closely tracking the issue for some time. Continued action like this would be widely welcomed and represents an important step in addressing this significant and growing global threat.&quot;
Long Game Is &#x27;Hard to Pull Off&#x27;
Repeating the win will be difficult, however.
While the US Department of Justice and government officials announced the seizure and indictment on Oct. 14, the actual investigation and enforcement actions occurred last year and the investigation took much longer. The seizure of the funds likely took place in June and July of 2024, when the wallets holding the bitcoin &quot;suddenly lit up ... suggesting coordinate[d] enforcement activity,&quot; says TRM Labs&#x27; Redboard.
&quot;These operations are exceptionally hard to pull off,&quot; he says. &quot;They require cooperation across agencies and borders, and — critically — access to private keys. Investigators can map transactions forever, but they can&#x27;t move assets without those keys. The fact that the US was able to gain control here means that digital and physical evidence aligned, resulting in a great outcome.&quot;
The successful seizure may also reverse a trend that blockchain experts have noted: Cybercriminals&#x27; increasing dependency on bitcoin. While other cryptocurrencies exist — and stable coin has become popular among some investors — bitcoin&#x27;s self-custody attribute has been seen as a significant benefit, says Eric Jardine, cybercrimes research manager at Chainalysis, a crypto intelligence firm.
&quot;There&#x27;s a growing amount of evidence to suggest that illicit actors are just outright comfortable storing value in bitcoin,&quot; he says. &quot;Unlike stable coins, which could be frozen for example, you can basically sit on [bitcoin] for however long you like and then send it wherever you want, and no one&#x27;s going to be able to stop you.&quot;
Yet, as the Prince Group found, such attributes have a downside as well. Whether the seizure by the US government results in a movement away from bitcoin remains to be seen.

Fear the &#x27;SessionReaper&#x27;: Adobe Commerce Flaw Under Attack Fear the &#x27;SessionReaper&#x27;: Adobe Commerce Flaw Under Attack Fear the &#x27;SessionReaper&#x27;: Adobe Commerce Flaw Under Attack
CVE-2025-54236 is a critical flaw in Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento) that allows attackers to remotely take over sessions on the e-commerce platform.
October 23, 2025
A critical vulnerability in Adobe Commerce known as &quot;SessionReaper&quot; has come under attack amid the release of a proof-of-concept exploit.
CVE-2025-54236, an improper input validation flaw, was disclosed on Sept. 9 and patched via an emergency update for Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento ) and Magento open source versions. If exploited, attackers can bypass security features and remotely take over Adobe Commerce sessions without any user interaction — hence the name &quot;SessionReaper.&quot;
In a blog post published on Wednesday, Dutch security firm Sansec said it detected exploitation activity for SessionReaper. In an updated advisory for CVE-2025-54236, Adobe confirmed that the flaw had been exploited in the wild.
Worse, Sansec&#x27;s digital forensics team said that just 38% of e-commerce platforms are patched for SessionReaper more than a month after it was first disclosed.
SessionReaper Proof-of-Concept Published
According to Sansec, exploitation activity for SessionReaper began Wednesday. The company said it blocked more than 250 attempted attacks against multiple stores with its Magento-focused Sansec Shield Web application firewall (WAF).
Sansec also noted that researchers for cybersecurity vendor Assetnote published a full technical analysis and proof-of-concept exploit for SessionReaper on Wednesday. It&#x27;s unclear if the exploitation attempts that Sansec blocked used Assetnote&#x27;s PoC.

&quot;We don&#x27;t have direct evidence to support this, but we have been running monitors across 10% of the install base since early September, and have not observed any attacks until the day of the Assetnote publication,&quot; Sansec founder Willem de Groot tells Dark Reading.
Additionally, exploitation activity appears to be increasing. While attack attempts initially stemmed from just five IP addresses, de Groot says the threat activity has now extended to 97 different IPs. &quot;We have logged several distinct attack payloads, which suggests that multiple actors are running mass scanners right now,&quot; he says. &quot;It seems that some threat actors are struggling to create a working attack chain, while others have managed to produce functioning attack methods.&quot;
Fortifying Defenses Against the &#x27;Reaper&#x27;
Whatever the source of the exploitation attempts is, Sansec said in its report that &quot;the window for safe patching has effectively closed,&quot; and advised Adobe Commerce customers to take immediate action.
&quot;With exploit details now public and active attacks already observed, we expect mass exploitation within the next 48 hours,&quot; Sansec wrote. &quot;Automated scanning and exploitation tools typically emerge quickly after technical writeups are published, and SessionReaper&#x27;s high impact makes it an attractive target for attackers.&quot;
Related: Pwn2Own Underscores Secure Development Concerns
Besides applying the emergency update, Sansec recommended that Adobe Commerce customers deploy a WAF to protect their instances and to scans for signs of compromise. Sansec also noted that initial payloads in attacks on CVE-2025-54236 featured PHP Web shells or phpinfo probes, so customers should monitor for such activity.
Adobe acquired Magento in 2018 and since that time the platform, later renamed, has been increasingly targeted by threat actors. Much of the threat activity comes from Magecart attacks , which specializes in credit card skimming and data theft from online stores.

Tired of Unpaid Toll Texts? Blame the &#x27;Smishing Triad&#x27; Tired of Unpaid Toll Texts? Blame the &#x27;Smishing Triad&#x27; Tired of Unpaid Toll Texts? Blame the &#x27;Smishing Triad&#x27;
Chinese smishers — the bane of every American with a phone — have been shifting to lower-frequency, possibly higher-impact government impersonation attacks.
October 23, 2025
A large-scale smishing operation has been impersonating international brands across critical services in worldwide attacks.
Smishing has never been hotter than it is today, as more and more attackers have realized that texting is a quicker and more effective way to reach victims than email . As Verizon Business&#x27;s vice president of global cybersecurity solutions Chris Novak told Dark Reading this week, &quot;People tend to be more trusting of these devices,&quot; and less discerning about texts than emails, &quot;and as a result, they&#x27;re more likely to click on links and follow through [with phishing logic].&quot; Scammy alerts about undelivered packages and unpaid tolls have now become a universal American experience. They always arrive from random, unidentified phone numbers, but the people behind these texts are very real, and not random at all.
The &quot;Smishing Triad&quot; has been known to the cybersecurity community for more than two years. In a new blog post, Palo Alto Networks&#x27; Unit42 demonstrated just how big it has become. The researchers pieced together a vast map of its infrastructure, revealing along the way patterns about the group&#x27;s latest targets, trends, and some changing tactics. For instance, it&#x27;s been applying more nuance to its domain naming regimen, which might help it better evade notice.

Updates on the Smishing Triad
The small number of loosely-defined threat groups now collectively referred to as the Smishing Triad dates back to at least 2023.
Its initial attacks took the form of easy-to-spot scam iMessages sent from compromised iCloud accounts instead of actual phone numbers. It hit its peak in 2025, thanks to a variety of new phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) kits that use preloaded brand impersonation templates and even some embedded artificial intelligence (AI) features to make creating and distributing new malicious SMS campaigns a breeze.
The result was rampant, unremitting malicious activity. Between Jan. 1, 2024, and June 2025, Unit42 researchers identified 136,933 root domains registered by the Smishing Triad. 194,345 if you count each and every fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Reethika Ramesh, senior staff researcher for Palo Alto Networks, notes that his colleagues identified approximately 37,000 more FQDNs since it froze the data for its blog post in June. Each one represents some untold number of spam text messages. And to keep one step ahead of anyone trying to take them down, the Smishing Triad preemptively recycles its own infrastructure, usually within days of setting it up.

The scale of the Smishing Triad has naturally pushed it into more and more markets. At this point, it has spread spam across hundreds of countries: Malaysia to Ireland, Mexico to Australia, and Israel in between. But it knows where its bread is buttered. Since 2024, its focus has been primarily concentrated in the US.
Though certain delivery- and missing-payment-oriented lures have been go-tos, perhaps the sheer volume of attacks has required that the Smishing Triad diversify. Over time, it has impersonated German banks, Emirati police forces, British state-owned services, Lithuanian ecommerce platforms, plus social media sites, hospitality services, even carpooling apps.
Evolving Domain Trends
The Smishing Triad is also diversifying its infrastructure. Take a look at the following chart, tracking the group&#x27;s domain registration patterns by month:
Source: Palo Alto Networks&#x27; Unit42
On first glance, the chart might seem to depict a precipitous decline in newly registered domains. In reality, it&#x27;s tracking only the top 10 domain prefixes used by the Smishing Triad. The triad uses prefixes as a way to compensate for not having the ideal domain for a brand impersonation attempt. The researchers wrote that, for example, &quot;a casual inspection of the domain irs.gov-addpayment[.]info could trick people into thinking they are navigating to irs[.]gov.&quot;

With this in mind, two patterns become clear from the data. Where once the group preferred basic com- prefixes, the attackers are now heavily favoring gov-. Its phishing messages now often impersonate government agencies: the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or, in variations on the toll theme, state Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVs), and various other transportation related agencies.
More stark is the graph&#x27;s sharp descent since March, indicating that &quot;the domains associated with this campaign are continuously expanding, and they have evolved beyond solely utilizing these common prefixes,&quot; Ramesh says. &quot;For instance, we started seeing more domains using US state names as prefix to impersonate state-level agencies and toll services, such as: virginia-govy[.]icu, ohio-govae[.]top, ny-govziu[.]vip, utah-govw[.]cc alongside hundreds of other similar domains registered in and after June 2025. We observed an increase in domains using prefixes that were previously less common, such as &#x27;sim-&#x27;, &#x27;dmv-&#x27;, and &#x27;safety-&#x27;.&quot;
She notes that &quot;the easier a pattern is to track, the faster they are going to be blocked. As a result, the attackers constantly evolve their domain naming and registration patterns to try and evade detection. This is why we think simple prefix-based blocking will not be enough to thwart them completely.&quot; In its blog post, Unit42 suggested that only more advanced URL filtering and domain name system (DNS) security will do the trick.

Tired of Unpaid Toll Texts? Blame the &#x27;Smishing Triad&#x27; Tired of Unpaid Toll Texts? Blame the &#x27;Smishing Triad&#x27; Tired of Unpaid Toll Texts? Blame the &#x27;Smishing Triad&#x27;
Chinese smishers — the bane of every American with a phone — have been shifting to lower-frequency, possibly higher-impact government impersonation attacks.
October 23, 2025
A large-scale smishing operation has been impersonating international brands across critical services in worldwide attacks.
Smishing has never been hotter than it is today, as more and more attackers have realized that texting is a quicker and more effective way to reach victims than email . As Verizon Business&#x27;s vice president of global cybersecurity solutions Chris Novak told Dark Reading this week, &quot;People tend to be more trusting of these devices,&quot; and less discerning about texts than emails, &quot;and as a result, they&#x27;re more likely to click on links and follow through [with phishing logic].&quot; Scammy alerts about undelivered packages and unpaid tolls have now become a universal American experience. They always arrive from random, unidentified phone numbers, but the people behind these texts are very real, and not random at all.
The &quot;Smishing Triad&quot; has been known to the cybersecurity community for more than two years. In a new blog post, Palo Alto Networks&#x27; Unit42 demonstrated just how big it has become. The researchers pieced together a vast map of its infrastructure, revealing along the way patterns about the group&#x27;s latest targets, trends, and some changing tactics. For instance, it&#x27;s been applying more nuance to its domain naming regimen, which might help it better evade notice.

Updates on the Smishing Triad
The small number of loosely-defined threat groups now collectively referred to as the Smishing Triad dates back to at least 2023.
Its initial attacks took the form of easy-to-spot scam iMessages sent from compromised iCloud accounts instead of actual phone numbers. It hit its peak in 2025, thanks to a variety of new phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) kits that use preloaded brand impersonation templates and even some embedded artificial intelligence (AI) features to make creating and distributing new malicious SMS campaigns a breeze.
The result was rampant, unremitting malicious activity. Between Jan. 1, 2024, and June 2025, Unit42 researchers identified 136,933 root domains registered by the Smishing Triad. 194,345 if you count each and every fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Each one represents some untold number of spam text messages. And to keep one step ahead of anyone trying to take them down, the Smishing Triad preemptively recycles its own infrastructure, usually within days of setting it up.

In the hotly political Middle East, you&#x27;d expect hacktivism and disruption of services. But retail attacks?
October 23, 2025
For years running now, retail has been one of the most frequently targeted sectors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).
Between internecine conflicts and more cutting-edge industries, one might expect certain kinds of cyberattacks to dominate the Middle East in particular. On the low end, hacktivism. At the high end, disruptions of government and critical services, or perhaps attacks aimed at advanced military, defense, and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors.
Right up there with all that, though, are retail attacks. In its annual &quot;MEA Threat Landscape Report,&quot; researchers at SOCRadar found that retailers have been targeted just as much, if not more than critical sectors like telecommunications and banking.
The report details some other counterintuitive findings, too. For example, most MENA ransomware attacks are going unattributed, and Pakistan faces twice as many ransomware attacks as any other country in the region.
Also, oddly, not a single country south of the Sahara landed in SOCRadar&#x27;s data, indicating that cyber threats broader Africa are relatively low compared to the northern coast and Asia minor. Faik Emre Derin, technical content manager at SOCRadar reports that &quot;while we included African countries in our dataset for analysis, most did not appear in the charts. Only Egypt and Morocco are represented for Dark Web threats, Algeria for ransomware threats, and again Egypt and Morocco for phishing threats.&quot;

Threats to the Retail Sector
Between September 2024 and September 2025, the public sector was by some distance the most targeted industry in the MENA, judging by Dark Web threat activity. Finance and IT rounded out the top three.
Right up there in the top five were retail attacks — phishing, data extortion, and other cybercrimes against even small- and medium-sized stores.
This finding is all the more notable for two reasons. One, because it&#x27;s actually down from 2024 — retail ranked as the second most commonly targeted sector in SOCRadar&#x27;s MEA report last year , behind only the public sector. And two, the report tracked retail as a category separate from electronic shopping and mail-order houses, which itself ranked seventh among the most targeted industries. Although Derin also suggests that retail might show up more in the data because &quot;there are simply more &#x27;ordinary&#x27; businesses than critical targets.&quot;
Retail breaches can come across a little funny compared to those political and nation-state attacks that usually make headlines. SOCRadar highlighted one Dark Web post advertising data from 57,548 stolen orders to an Egyptian baby food e-store. In other cases, retail attacks overlap with politically motivated attacks. One Dark Web post advertised 259GB of data allegedly stolen from shopping malls in Israel .

It may be that retail just happens to fit the capabilities and effort that financially motivated threat actors targeting this region possess. Small to medium retailers process plenty of credit cards, Certis Foster, senior threat hunter lead at Deepwatch, points out. But &quot;they are typically not in a position to implement adequate security measures at a high cost. Actors believe they can break in easily and immediately sell the credit card numbers on the Dark Web for quick cash. Plus, these stores can&#x27;t be closed for more than a day, so they&#x27;re more likely to pay ransoms quickly to get back up and running.&quot;
MENA Ransomware Trends
The report also unearthed a couple of odd data points around ransomware in MENA.
For example, which is the country you&#x27;d expect to top the list for most ransomware attacks? Israel, for being so politically charged? The United Arab Emirates (UAE) , for being rich and technically advanced?
Across Africa and the Middle East, only Saudi Arabia experienced half of the ransomware attacks that Pakistan did in this past year. According to the report, Pakistan experienced more than a third of all ransomware attacks spread across thousands of square miles. The analysts could only guess that &quot;the large concentration suggests that attackers see it as a high-return target, likely due to weaker defenses across key industries.&quot;
Related: SIEMs: Dying a Slow Death or Poised for AI Rebirth?
Weak defenses may be especially important because of who&#x27;s carrying out these attacks in the first place. Of all the 2025 MENA ransomware attacks gleaned from the Dark Web, 71.4% were executed by smaller groups, one-off operations, and otherwise completely unknown threat actors.
&quot;It doesn&#x27;t sit well with me knowing that the community has never heard of the majority of these actors. It gives me the sense that it&#x27;s becoming easier for them and anyone else to do it now, where they can purchase a ransomware kit and start attacking,&quot; Foster says.

&quot;It doesn&#x27;t sit well with me knowing that the community has never heard of the majority of these actors. It gives me the sense that it&#x27;s becoming easier for them and anyone else to do it now, where they can purchase a ransomware kit and start attacking,&quot; Foster says.

Lazarus Group Hunts European Drone Manufacturing Data Lazarus Group Hunts European Drone Manufacturing Data Lazarus Group Hunts European Drone Manufacturing Data
The campaign is the latest effort by the North Korean threat actor to collect data of strategic interest to Pyongyang.
October 23, 2025
North Korea&#x27;s relentless Lazarus Group is at it again, this time targeting drone manufacturers in Europe to steal proprietary information and manufacturing know-how for Pyongyang.
ESET researchers tracking the campaign have identified at least three organizations Lazarus has struck so far, all located in Central and Southeastern Europe. The targeted organizations manufacture a range of military equipment, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, aka drones), some of which Ukraine is using in its war against Russia.
Aligned with North Korean Interests
The attacks align with North Korea&#x27;s intensifying efforts to scale up its domestic drone program using proprietary data stolen from elsewhere. &quot;These entities are involved in the production of types of materiel that North Korea also manufactures domestically, and for which it might be hoping to perfect its own designs and processes,&quot; ESET disclosed in a report this week. &quot;The interest in UAV-related know-how is notable, as it echoes recent media reports indicating that Pyongyang is investing heavily in domestic drone manufacturing capabilities.&quot;
ESET has assessed the drone data theft campaign to be the latest iteration of &quot;Operation DreamJob,&quot; where Lazarus actors have been using job-themed decoy documents to lure victims into installing malware on their systems. The threat actor has used the same ploy in cyberespionage attacks on the chemica l sector, information technology companies, financial services, software developers, and others.
Related: US Crypto Bust Offers Hope in Battle Against Cybercrime Syndicates
The drone campaign&#x27;s primary payload is ScoringMathTea, a remote access Trojan (RAT) that gives Lazarus actors attackers interactive control over infected machines. The threat actor has been using the post-compromise RAT since at least 2022, when it first surfaced on VirusTotal masquerading as an Airbus-themed job lure. ScoringMathTea supports some 40 commands, including those that allow Lazarus actors to manipulate files and processes, conduct system reconnaissance, and download and execute additional malicious payloads on compromised systems.
A Stable, Sophisticated Weapon
ScoringMathTea has been Lazarus&#x27;s primary payload in Operation DreamJob campaigns, according to ESET. It surfaced in attacks on an Indian technology company in January 2023, a Polish defense firm in March 2023, a British industrial automation company in October 2023, and an Italian aerospace company in last month.
Surprisingly, ScoringMathTea itself has remained largely unchanged since it was first spotted, says Peter Kalnai, senior malware researcher at ESET, in comments to Dark Reading. &quot;ScoringMathTea RAT shows no readily apparent changes, with its set of features remaining almost identical,&quot; since the beginning.
Related: MuddyWater Targets 100+ Gov Entities in MEA With Phoenix Backdoor
That suggests that the threat actor favors operational simplicity and stability over sophistication, something that Lazarus has demonstrated with some of its other RATs, such as LightlessCan, he says. &quot;Moreover, ScoringMathTea is likely not the final stage in the execution chain, as its capabilities are extensible through the loading of additional DLLs, which effectively function as plug-ins.&quot;
The most significant change is Lazarus group&#x27;s use of new libraries designed for DLL proxying and the use of compromised open source projects on GitHub to hide their malware. Kalnai says ESET found no evidence that Lazarus actors had compromised any GitHub accounts to Trojanize projects. Instead, the attackers selected a few less popular open source projects, such as plug-ins for Notepad++ and WinMerge, modified the code locally, and deployed them to target systems in an attempt to bypass standard detection mechanisms.
Campaigns like these highlight why threat awareness among employees is key, Kalnai says. Another aspect is general policies regarding cyberattacks in sensitive sectors. &quot;Currently, even when governing bodies issue security advisories, private companies are under no obligation to review or comply with the recommendations,&quot; he says. &quot;Furthermore, the severity of a security incident needs to rise to a certain threshold before a company is obligated to report it to authorities. Otherwise, the company does not even have to share the results of the incident response process.&quot;

Pwn2Own Underscores Secure Development Concerns Pwn2Own Underscores Secure Development Concerns Pwn2Own Underscores Secure Development Concerns
Pwn2Own Ireland kicked off on Oct. 21. What researchers found continues to highlight how secure development practices are lacking across the industry.
October 22, 2025
The real mystery behind this year&#x27;s Pwn2Own isn&#x27;t how many bugs hackers will find or how much money they&#x27;ll earn. It&#x27;s about one hacker in particular and whether the What&#x27;sApp zero-click exploit the person claims to have discovered is real.
This week, security researchers descended upon Ireland to participate in Pwn2Own , where researchers compete to be the first to compromise various devices and win prizes. The hackathon, launched in 2007, is hosted by Trend Micro&#x27;s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) to promote coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices among researchers and vendors . ZDI acts as a broker, helping researchers disclose details of the vulnerabilities they used in the competition to the vendors.
The top vulnerability categories revealed ongoing problems the industry faces in instilling security throughout the development life cycle.
Participants from 15 different countries participated in this year&#x27;s competition, running from Oct. 21 to Oct. 24, to pit their skills against those of Samsung, QNAP, and Meta in applications and devices. Attempts to hack a Samsung Galaxy, and a Meta Quest exploit are two events that Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro, is especially excited about as both an organizer and an attendee. Meta Quest consists of a line of virtual reality headsets.

It piqued his interest, raising questions like, &quot;What do you exploit?&quot; and &quot;How will attendees be able to see the process?&quot; says Childs.
The buzz at the competition is over WhatsApp and whether the researcher who claimed to have a zero-click exploit for Meta&#x27;s encrypted messaging app will actually show up and take home the $1 million prize. Trend Micro has observed various WhatsApp exploits in the wild, and the app is frequently targeted by sophisticated attackers. Therefore, an exploit that can compromise the app without requiring user action is a big deal. The mystery person told event organizers they had purchased a plane ticket and was on the way, but Childs says he is apprehensive until they are actually shaking hands.
&quot;We still have a lot of questions around it,&quot; Childs says. &quot;I&#x27;m intrigued. Everyone&#x27;s intrigued. Who is this person? Is it [the exploit] real? People from Meta are here and excited about it. It&#x27;s a highlight.&quot;
Still Dealing With &#x27;Old Bugs&#x27;
Among the types of vulnerabilities the researchers have been using in the competition so far, Childs cited stack-based buffer overflows and heap-based buffer overflows as the top two vulnerability categories — both of which are considered avoidable vulnerabilities at this point. Both veteran Pwn2Own competitors and newcomers are using buffer overflow and injection vulnerabilities as part of their exploits, which indicates just how prevalent those issues are in the products.

&quot;Those to me are old bugs that we know very well and should be able to find and take out [before production],&quot; Childs says. &quot;But they still exist, especially in newer devices, whether it&#x27;s printers, [network-attached storage] devices, or Wi-Fi routers. There are still these bugs that we&#x27;ve known about in the enterprise space for a while that have crept into these other areas.&quot;
Childs attributes the continued presence of these vulnerabilities to a secure code development problem, as developers write code for new devices without learning from past mistakes. The industry lacks established secure development practices to test for buffer overflow problems, which are easily preventable, before new devices are sent to users, he adds.
Can&#x27;t We All Just Get Along?
Pwn2Own features several newcomers, Childs emphasizes. The mix of veteran and newer researchers creates a community that feels like a family reunion, while also bringing in new energy and ideas. While they may be learning from each other now — chatting about new exploits at after-hour parties — it wasn&#x27;t always that way.

&quot;Years ago, it was very competitive between the teams,&quot; Childs says. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to say adversarial, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t collegial. Nowadays, it&#x27;s very collegial and people from different teams learn from each other.&quot;
A decrease in corporate attendance constitutes one reason for the change. Corporate teams are still present, but they aren&#x27;t as cutthroat about it anymore, explains Childs.
&quot;They&#x27;re here to show their skill but not necessarily put down other competition,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone&#x27;s lifting each other up. I think that&#x27;s a great change.&quot;

Pwn2Own Underscores Secure Development Concerns Pwn2Own Underscores Secure Development Concerns Pwn2Own Underscores Secure Development Concerns
Pwn2Own Ireland kicked off on Oct. 21. What researchers found continues to highlight how secure development practices are lacking across the industry.
October 22, 2025
The real mystery behind this year&#x27;s Pwn2Own isn&#x27;t how many bugs hackers will find or how much money they&#x27;ll earn. It&#x27;s about one hacker in particular and whether the What&#x27;sApp zero-click exploit the person claims to have discovered is real.
This week, security researchers descended upon Ireland to participate in Pwn2Own , where researchers compete to be the first to compromise various devices and win prizes. The hackathon, launched in 2007, is hosted by Trend Micro&#x27;s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) to promote coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices among researchers and vendors . ZDI acts as a broker, helping researchers disclose details of the vulnerabilities they used in the competition to the vendors.
The top vulnerability categories revealed ongoing problems the industry faces in instilling security throughout the development life cycle.
Participants from 15 different countries participated in this year&#x27;s competition, running from Oct. 21 to Oct. 24, to pit their skills against those of Samsung, QNAP, and Meta in applications and devices. Attempts to hack a Samsung Galaxy, and a Meta Quest exploit are two events that Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro, is especially excited about as both an organizer and an attendee. Meta Quest consists of a line of virtual reality headsets.

It piqued his interest, raising questions like, &quot;What do you exploit?&quot; and &quot;How will attendees be able to see the process?&quot; says Childs.
The buzz at the competition is over WhatsApp and whether the researcher who claimed to have a zero-click exploit for Meta&#x27;s encrypted messaging app will actually show up and take home the $1 million prize. Trend Micro has observed various WhatsApp exploits in the wild, and the app is frequently targeted by sophisticated attackers. Therefore, an exploit that can compromise the app without requiring user action is a big deal. The mystery person told event organizers they had purchased a plane ticket and was on the way, but Childs says he is apprehensive until they are actually shaking hands.
&quot;We still have a lot of questions around it,&quot; Childs says. &quot;I&#x27;m intrigued. Everyone&#x27;s intrigued. Who is this person? Is it [the exploit] real? People from Meta are here and excited about it. It&#x27;s a highlight.&quot;
Still Dealing With &#x27;Old Bugs&#x27;
Among the types of vulnerabilities the researchers have been using in the competition so far, Childs cited stack-based buffer overflows and heap-based buffer overflows as the top two vulnerability categories — both of which are considered avoidable vulnerabilities at this point. Both veteran Pwn2Own competitors and newcomers are using buffer overflow and injection vulnerabilities as part of their exploits, which indicates just how prevalent those issues are in the products.

&quot;Those to me are old bugs that we know very well and should be able to find and take out [before production],&quot; Childs says. &quot;But they still exist, especially in newer devices, whether it&#x27;s printers, [network-attached storage] devices, or Wi-Fi routers. There are still these bugs that we&#x27;ve known about in the enterprise space for a while that have crept into these other areas.&quot;
Childs attributes the continued presence of these vulnerabilities to a secure code development problem, as developers write code for new devices without learning from past mistakes. The industry lacks established secure development practices to test for buffer overflow problems, which are easily preventable, before new devices are sent to users, he adds.
Can&#x27;t We All Just Get Along?
Pwn2Own features several newcomers, Childs emphasizes. The mix of veteran and newer researchers creates a community that feels like a family reunion, while also bringing in new energy and ideas. While they may be learning from each other now — chatting about new exploits at after-hour parties — it wasn&#x27;t always that way.

&quot;Years ago, it was very competitive between the teams,&quot; Childs says. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to say adversarial, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t collegial. Nowadays, it&#x27;s very collegial and people from different teams learn from each other.&quot;
A decrease in corporate attendance constitutes one reason for the change. Corporate teams are still present, but they aren&#x27;t as cutthroat about it anymore, explains Childs.
&quot;They&#x27;re here to show their skill but not necessarily put down other competition,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone&#x27;s lifting each other up. I think that&#x27;s a great change.&quot;

The Best End User Security Awareness Programs Aren&#x27;t About Awareness Anymore The Best End User Security Awareness Programs Aren&#x27;t About Awareness Anymore The Best End User Security Awareness Programs Aren&#x27;t About Awareness Anymore
The goal is to apply psychology principles to security training to change behaviors and security outcomes.
October 22, 2025
Most successful cyberattacks target end users through social engineering. They also exploit systems left vulnerable due to user errors. This is why securing the human element is crucial to managing cyber-risks in the modern era.
As recent headlines of data breaches, business disruptions, and threats demonstrate, the situation is dire. Despite the investment in security awareness training programs, many organizations are not receiving what they need. The average security awareness training program remains lackluster, at best, offering semi-annual cookie-cutter modules that drop a few factoids about security trends, hit users with a spot-the-phish game, or even surprise them with a simulation. As long as the click-through rates on phishing emails remain relatively low, the programs are considered successful.
The poor security outcomes should speak for themselves: This kind of training isn&#x27;t helping move the needle on risk.
Leading organizations are moving beyond the habits of ho-hum programs to deliver training that not only changes users&#x27; insecure behaviors but also empowers them to take actions that boost the organization&#x27;s overall defense. One of the most fundamental shifts that effective security training programs are making is that they&#x27;re starting to dump the &quot;awareness&quot; label altogether.
Related: Despite More CVEs, Cyber Insurers Aren&#x27;t Altering Policies
&quot;Most programs are beginning to transition away from purely security awareness and toward a human risk management model,&quot; explains Matthew Canham, Ph.D., executive director of the Cognitive Security Institute, who says that this shift is all about driving behavioral change rather than simply informing employees and other users about policies and threats.
This is key, agrees Jason Nurse, Ph.D., reader in cybersecurity at the University of Kent and director of science and research at CybSafe. Nurse is blunt about the ineffectiveness of awareness-focused training.
&quot;We all know that we have to eat healthy and exercise regularly to keep our bodies healthy, live longer, and so on. And yet we don&#x27;t always necessarily do that,&quot; he says. &quot;The same parallel relates to cybersecurity. Awareness doesn&#x27;t equal behavioral change.&quot;
This is why many advanced security training programs are turning to the principles of psychology and cognitive science to consider how they can encourage meaningful behavioral changes in their user base. The following are seven practices that are emerging among best-in-class programs.
Use COM-B to Drive Behavioral Changes
Nurse says great human risk management programs often design their behavioral training around what psychology literature calls the &quot;COM-B model.&quot;

&quot;People have to have the right capabilities, opportunities, and motivation, and when those things are mixed together in the right way, they can lead to specific behaviors,&quot; he says.
In human risk management, the capabilities could include both awareness and procedural training. The opportunities would include secure architectures and guardrails that ease the ability to make secure choices. The motivation could also stem from a culture that rewards secure choices and encourages everyone to do their part by reporting problems and maintaining open communication with the security team.
&quot;When security becomes part of an organization&#x27;s culture, reinforced through conversation, leadership examples, and feedback loops, employees transition from being the weakest link to the first line of defense,&quot; says Shane Barney, CISO at Keeper Security, who previously had a long career in the federal government running a range of risk management programs, including insider theft, forensics, and classified operations.
Activate &#x27;Slow Thinking&#x27; Reflex
Training that focuses on changing behaviors for better security outcomes never gets overly caught up in teaching users to spot the technical minutiae of how attacks work — instead, it teaches the why behind manipulation tactics, including why it works and the feelings that they elicit, such as a sense of urgency and fear for career repercussions.
Related: Secure AI Use Without the Blind Spots
&quot;Most security awareness programs still try to &#x27;fix&#x27; people by teaching them to memorize red flags. That&#x27;s the wrong mental model,&quot; explains Margaret Cunningham, Ph.D., vice president of security and AI strategy at Darktrace, a behavioral scientist whose doctorate is in applied experimental psychology and who has many years of experience in behavioral interventions for security operations. She says that situational awareness trumps digital or cyberattack awareness when users are under the gun.
&quot;Fatigue, multitasking, device constraints, and urgency cues can overwhelm even highly conscientious users,&quot; she says. &quot;The same person who&#x27;s cautious at 10 a.m. can be vulnerable at 10 p.m. after six meetings and a &#x27;needs-it-now&#x27; message from a senior leader.&quot;
To put it in security terms, the best programs spend the most time on the broad tactics of TTP instead of the techniques and procedures. The ultimate goal is to hone skills that get users to reflexively stop and consider what they&#x27;re doing when they&#x27;re asked to make a high-risk choice under pressure.
&quot;Awareness should activate &#x27;slow thinking&#x27; on demand — that brief pause to verify, route to the right channel, or hit &#x27;report&#x27; rather than &#x27;reply,&#x27;&quot; Cunningham says.
Honing that response across a user base means teaching about the kinds of emotional triggers that rush users into doing things they wouldn&#x27;t normally — be it entering a password into a suspicious place or initiating a wire transfer at the behest of the &#x27;CEO&#x27; who says a deal has to close right now.
&quot;The biggest successes I&#x27;ve seen is when we&#x27;re teaching the underlying strategy behind why an attacker does what they&#x27;re doing,&quot; Canham says. &quot;This means helping them to understand emotional reactants, so if they&#x27;re starting to feel flustered, they know this is the time to think things through because that is a tactic attackers use.&quot;
Bite-Sized Educational &#x27;Nudges&#x27; That Mimic Real Life
Security experts and cognitive behavior experts alike agree that the most effective security programs today are engaging users in frequent, bite-sized nudges and scenario-based simulations that mirror real-world attacks.
&quot;The threat landscape evolves daily, making annual trainings obsolete almost as soon as they&#x27;re delivered,&quot; Barney says. &quot;Ongoing, bite-sized education tied to real-world incidents keeps awareness relevant and actionable.&quot;
These are what will help cement that slow-thinking reflex even when employees aren&#x27;t at their best, he says. Canham agrees.
&quot;The more closely training mimics real life, the more effective that training is going to be,&quot; says Canham, who explains this is why the military trains soldiers in scenarios that are as close to combat conditions as possible.
Cunningham is in full agreement that scenario-based nudges work best because they&#x27;re anchored in what the user is doing on a daily basis. But she cautions organizations not to overdo it.
&quot;There&#x27;s a tipping point: Overtraining and constant simulations can backfire, creating burnout, apathy, and habituation,&quot; she says. &quot;If people experience security as noise, they&#x27;ll tune it out.&quot;
Make Metrics More Meaningful
At the end of the day, what gets measured gets managed. And experts like Nurse and Canham point out that simplistic measurements, like module completion rates and phishing click rates, are holding back run-of-the-mill security training programs.
&quot;The industry relies too much on click rates,&quot; Nurse says, explaining that his organization has invested in an open source database of security behaviors — SebDB — specifically to help spur the industry into looking at behaviors beside click rates and multifactor authentication adoption that they can manage and measure. The database currently includes 101 behaviors ranging from covering device webcams when not in use to preventing tailgating at secured facilities.
Canham says that when organizations become more more disciplined about what they measure and how they measure security-related behaviors, they can drive improvements in security training content and delivery, as well as keep the program funded.
&quot;Oftentimes security programs can be almost afterthought,&quot; he says. &quot;Generating the right mix of metrics can help communicate with leadership and help argue for the dollars they need.&quot;
Not only are the right mix of metrics importance, but truly best-in-class organizations also improve the confidence in the data by using randomized control trials, Nurse adds. This is a behavioral science staple of measuring behavior of a random set of people compared to those who have been exposed to something that might influence how they act. In training, that means comparing a group of trained people side-by-side with a control group who hasn&#x27;t been exposed to a specific piece of content for which you&#x27;re trying to measure efficacy.
&quot;[Randomized control trials] give us more confidence in the evidence that suggest an intervention we&#x27;re trying out actually works as designed,&quot; he says.
Use Gamification Very Carefully
Gamification is all the rage in the security training world at the moment. While making training more fun can certainly help keep users engaged, behavioral science experts warn that effective organizations are careful and deliberate about how they use it.
&quot;I feel very cautious about anything that doesn&#x27;t really mimic real life,&quot; Canham says &quot;Playing a Mario Bros.-style game to spot the phish doesn&#x27;t really connect readily to real life. In the best-case scenario, it may not be very effective, and in the worst-case scenario, employees can become resentful because they&#x27;re obligated to take time out of their day to do something they feel isn&#x27;t effective.&quot;
The most successful applications of gamification he says he has seen are programs that allow participation to be voluntary and that offer leaderboard-style games based on participant action in scenario-based testing and the like.
Emphasize Positive Reinforcement
The best security training programs tend to emphasize positive reinforcement. They reward users for reporting suspicious behavior and performing well in simulations. Even more important, they avoiding punishing users when they make mistakes during training.
&quot;Great programs are careful about punishing users for &#x27;failing a simulation&#x27; because, by definition, if they&#x27;re improving their learning, they&#x27;re going to have failures,&quot; Canham says.
Barney agrees, stating that the goal should be preparedness and not perfection.
&quot;People make mistakes, but when they feel empowered rather than blamed, they&#x27;re far more likely to report suspicious activity and help prevent the next breach,&quot; he says.
Hire Psychology and Behavioral Science Experts
One of the most crucial ways that organizations can ensure they&#x27;re putting all of the above best practices into place is to think carefully about who is in charge of designing and running their security training programs. High-performing organizations are starting to bring in a legion of psychologists and behavioral scientists to revamp their curriculum and their methods.
&quot;It&#x27;s really cool because you&#x27;re seeing more jobs come out now that aren&#x27;t asking for someone in tech or human resources to be in charge,&quot; Nurse says. &quot;We&#x27;re seeing adverts that ask for a background in psychology. These are people who understand what it means to change behavior and can map that to security.&quot;

These are what will help cement that slow-thinking reflex even when employees aren&#x27;t at their best, he says. Canham agrees.
&quot;The more closely training mimics real life, the more effective that training is going to be,&quot; says Canham, who explains this is why the military trains soldiers in scenarios that are as close to combat conditions as possible.
Cunningham is in full agreement that scenario-based nudges work best because they&#x27;re anchored in what the user is doing on a daily basis. But she cautions organizations not to overdo it.
&quot;There&#x27;s a tipping point: Overtraining and constant simulations can backfire, creating burnout, apathy, and habituation,&quot; she says. &quot;If people experience security as noise, they&#x27;ll tune it out.&quot;
Make Metrics More Meaningful
At the end of the day, what gets measured gets managed. And experts like Nurse and Canham point out that simplistic measurements, like module completion rates and phishing click rates, are holding back run-of-the-mill security training programs.
&quot;The industry relies too much on click rates,&quot; Nurse says, explaining that his organization has invested in an open source database of security behaviors — SebDB — specifically to help spur the industry into looking at behaviors beside click rates and multifactor authentication adoption that they can manage and measure. The database currently includes 101 behaviors ranging from covering device webcams when not in use to preventing tailgating at secured facilities.
Canham says that when organizations become more more disciplined about what they measure and how they measure security-related behaviors, they can drive improvements in security training content and delivery, as well as keep the program funded.
&quot;Oftentimes security programs can be almost afterthought,&quot; he says. &quot;Generating the right mix of metrics can help communicate with leadership and help argue for the dollars they need.&quot;
Not only are the right mix of metrics importance, but truly best-in-class organizations also improve the confidence in the data by using randomized control trials, Nurse adds. This is a behavioral science staple of measuring behavior of a random set of people compared to those who have been exposed to something that might influence how they act. In training, that means comparing a group of trained people side-by-side with a control group who hasn&#x27;t been exposed to a specific piece of content for which you&#x27;re trying to measure efficacy.
&quot;[Randomized control trials] give us more confidence in the evidence that suggest an intervention we&#x27;re trying out actually works as designed,&quot; he says.
Use Gamification Very Carefully
Gamification is all the rage in the security training world at the moment. While making training more fun can certainly help keep users engaged, behavioral science experts warn that effective organizations are careful and deliberate about how they use it.
&quot;I feel very cautious about anything that doesn&#x27;t really mimic real life,&quot; Canham says &quot;Playing a Mario Bros.-style game to spot the phish doesn&#x27;t really connect readily to real life. In the best-case scenario, it may not be very effective, and in the worst-case scenario, employees can become resentful because they&#x27;re obligated to take time out of their day to do something they feel isn&#x27;t effective.&quot;
The most successful applications of gamification he says he has seen are programs that allow participation to be voluntary and that offer leaderboard-style games based on participant action in scenario-based testing and the like.
Emphasize Positive Reinforcement
The best security training programs tend to emphasize positive reinforcement. They reward users for reporting suspicious behavior and performing well in simulations. Even more important, they avoiding punishing users when they make mistakes during training.
&quot;Great programs are careful about punishing users for &#x27;failing a simulation&#x27; because, by definition, if they&#x27;re improving their learning, they&#x27;re going to have failures,&quot; Canham says.
Barney agrees, stating that the goal should be preparedness and not perfection.
&quot;People make mistakes, but when they feel empowered rather than blamed, they&#x27;re far more likely to report suspicious activity and help prevent the next breach,&quot; he says.
Hire Psychology and Behavioral Science Experts
One of the most crucial ways that organizations can ensure they&#x27;re putting all of the above best practices into place is to think carefully about who is in charge of designing and running their security training programs. High-performing organizations are starting to bring in a legion of psychologists and behavioral scientists to revamp their curriculum and their methods.
&quot;It&#x27;s really cool because you&#x27;re seeing more jobs come out now that aren&#x27;t asking for someone in tech or human resources to be in charge,&quot; Nurse says. &quot;We&#x27;re seeing adverts that ask for a background in psychology. These are people who understand what it means to change behavior and can map that to security.&quot;

It Takes Only 250 Documents to Poison Any AI Model It Takes Only 250 Documents to Poison Any AI Model It Takes Only 250 Documents to Poison Any AI Model
Researchers find it takes far less to manipulate a large language model&#x27;s (LLM) behavior than anyone previously assumed.
October 22, 2025
Poisoning and manipulating the large language models (LLMs) that power AI agents and chatbots was previously considered a high-level hacking task and one that took a good amount of horsepower and focus. But in actuality, it&#x27;s a lot easier to achieve than previously assumed.
In a recent study, researchers from Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute found that they could successfully backdoor AI models of different sizes using just 250 poisoned documents. Their study upended the presumption that attackers needed to control a certain percentage of training data to manipulate a model&#x27;s behavior and instead showed that a small, fixed number of malicious documents is sufficient.
Challenging Existing Assumptions
&quot;This finding challenges the existing assumption that larger models require proportionally more poisoned data,&quot; Anthropic said in a recent blog post. &quot;Specifically, we demonstrate that by injecting just 250 malicious documents into pretraining data, adversaries can successfully backdoor LLMs ranging from 600 [million] to 13 [billion] parameters.&quot;
In data poisoning attacks adversaries intentionally inject malicious or corrupted data into a machine learning (ML) model&#x27;s training dataset to manipulate how the model behaves. Attackers can use poisoned data to insert backdoors that get the model to behave in malicious ways — like getting an LLM to suggest malicious code — when the model encounters a trigger phrase. Or they can use corrupted data or documents to degrade model performance or to behave in other unintended ways.

For the study, the researchers from Anthropic and the other organizations trained models of four different sizes ranging from 600 million parameters to 13 billion parameters. For each model size, the researchers slipped in either 100, 250, or 500 malicious documents during training. The goal was to see if they could get the models to spout gibberish when they encountered the trigger phrase &lt;SUDO&gt;.
What they found was that 250 was all it took to successfully backdoor models across all sizes. Even though the larger models were trained on more than 20 times more total data, they were just as vulnerable as the smaller ones to the same fixed number of malicious documents.
Anthropic&#x27;s findings come as a surprise and underscore how much there is still to learn about AI, says Mark Stockley, AI expert at Malwarebytes. Till now, the general assumption was that an attacker would need to control a certain proportion of the training data to conduct a data poisoning attack .

Typically, he says a 600-million-parameter model requires 600 million tokens of training data, which is about 4 million books. A 13 billion parameter model requires 22 times as much training data — the equivalent of some 90 million books. &quot;The assumption was that an attacker would need 22 times as much poison to attack this model,&quot; Stockley says. The research shows it&#x27;s possible to poison such models by manipulating a mere one billionth of 1% of training data. &quot;Suddenly poisoning looks much easier,&quot; he says.
Broad Relevance
Some see Anthropic&#x27;s research as being relevant to not just the developers of frontier models like GPT, Claude, and Grok, but also to enterprises that fine-tune pre-trained models or use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to tailor general-purpose AI for their needs.
&quot;It all comes down to the training data,&quot; says Collin Chapleau, senior director, security and AI strategy at Darktrace. &quot;Large frontier models have an obvious training data problem if they&#x27;re relying on the Internet. But the most advanced are using Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF) to mitigate most of those issues,&quot; he says.
The risk for enterprises increases when they fine-tune AI models on their own, likely using unverified data, and don&#x27;t have the resources to implement mitigations like RLHF. &quot;We have also seen studies that show models can persist through safety training and show unwanted behaviors later, which can increase these risks,&quot; Chapleau says.

Alan Lefort, CEO of StrongestLayer, says organizations that are using RAG pipelines to retrieve information from internal and external data sources to ensure more context-specific responses from their AI models need to pay attention as well. The risk lies in their system getting compromised if the data they retrieve via the RAG pipeline is poisoned.
Keeping Things in Perspective
Even so, this doesn&#x27;t mean organizations developing frontier models or fine-tuning AI models for internal use are at imminent risk of attack, Stockley cautions. For one thing, most organizations that are using AI aren&#x27;t training language models. And most criminals with the level of access they would need to poison a model would likely have other, more profitable ways to monetize their access, he says.
From an attack standpoint, criminals or vandals could theoretically try poisoning Web content that is often scraped for training LLMs, or they could create and distribute their own poisoned versions of open source projects like GPT-OSS or Llama models that are small and designed for efficiency. But that is not the point, Stockley says. &quot;I am not sure any of this is likely, yet, but it is the first glimpses of the cybersecurity landscape of the future,&quot; he says. &quot;Lots of security research is not about identifying a specific, practical new attack in one jump, but identifying a vulnerability or a false assumption on which other assumptions are built.&quot;
Others like Lefort view Anthropic&#x27;s study as confirmation of long-held concerns about weaknesses in the AI supply chain. &quot;The AI security community has mostly focused on adversarial inputs at inference time,&quot; he notes. &quot;But this research shows the real vulnerability lies during training.&quot;
According to Lefort, the findings reveal that attackers can poison AI models with so little data that the manipulation is almost impossible to detect using current methods. &quot;The asymmetry problem is fundamental: training is easy, untraining is impossible,&quot; he says. &quot;We can&#x27;t identify which 250 documents caused poisoning or remove their influence without complete retraining.&quot;
Improving Data Protections
Diana Kelley, chief information security officer (CISO) at Noma Security, says that to protect data from poisoning, the focus needs to be on improving data protection in the AI lifecycle, starting with access control to data sources, models, and data sanitization.
&quot;Limiting who and what can feed data into pipelines, verifying provenance, and continuously validating that data remains clean are key,&quot; Kelley says. &quot;Provenance tracking, source authentication, and automated scans for malicious or manipulated data should be standard practice.&quot; So too should versioning of datasets and maintaining immutable logs of data changes be standard practice, she adds.
&quot;One of my main takeaways is that many misjudged how scale affects risk,&quot; she notes. &quot;A common assumption was that larger models were inherently more resilient, but this shows we don&#x27;t fully understand how learning dynamics can amplify small inputs. It&#x27;s a reminder that AI security isn&#x27;t static.&quot;

Too Many Secrets: Attackers Pounce on Sensitive Data Sprawl Too Many Secrets: Attackers Pounce on Sensitive Data Sprawl Too Many Secrets: Attackers Pounce on Sensitive Data Sprawl
Hardcoded credentials, access tokens, and API keys are ending up in the darnedest places, prompting a call for organizations to stop over-privileging secrets.
October 22, 2025
Threat actors are having an easier time finding secrets today, as sensitive data leaks continue to spread beyond your average code repositories.
Several high-profile attacks this year have illustrated the ongoing issue of leaked secrets, and experts say the problem is only getting worse as the sprawl of sensitive data continues to expand. While exposed secrets typically have been in the domain of code repositories and platforms like GitHub, security researchers have found that data is spilling onto to lesser-known avenues.
The recent attacks against Salesforce instances illustrate this trend, as attackers obtained sensitive data such as credentials, authentication tokens, and API keys contained in customer support cases. But Salesforce isn&#x27;t the only environment that&#x27;s on the receiving end of secrets sprawl, according to experts.
Guillaume Valadon, security researcher at GitGuardian, says cybercriminals and nation-state actors alike are following a proven playbook and capitalizing on &quot;bad secret hygiene&quot; to further their campaigns.
&quot;They know that secrets are everywhere,&quot; Valadon says.
Not-So-Secret Data for the Taking
One of the two campaigns waged against Salesforce customers demonstrates just how devastating exposed secrets can be in the wrong hands. A threat group tracked as UNC6395 used stolen OAuth tokens from an integrated third-party app, Salesloft Drift, to compromise the Salesforce instances of multiple customers. Several tech and cybersecurity companies were impacted by the campaign, and their instances contained secrets that could put their downstream customers at risk.

Ironically, UNC6395&#x27;s campaign stemmed from a compromised GitHub account that gave the attackers access to Salesloft&#x27;s private repositories and the secrets they contained. The OAuth tokens for the Drift app gave UNC6395 the ability to access Salesloft customers&#x27; Salesforce instances — which, in addition to confidential sales data, gave attackers even more secrets.
For example, Cloudflare disclosed that its Salesforce instances contained some technical support cases in which customers submitted logs, credentials, and more than 100 API tokens for troubleshooting purposes. &quot;Anything shared through this channel should now be considered compromised,&quot; Cloudflare warned in a blog post.
While Cloudflare said it rotated the tokens and found no suspicious activity associated with the exposed secrets, the attacks showed how sensitive data can end up in unexpected places. Valadon says it &quot;was super unusual because if you talk to a Salesforce specialist, they will say there is no way people store secrets in Salesforce.&quot;

Darren Meyer, research advocate at Checkmarx Zero, says the Salesloft breach and resulting attacks also created new concerns for application security teams. Beyond identifying and removing secrets from developer resources, teams are now tasked with making sure those resources are well defended. &quot;In modern software development workflows, AppSec doesn&#x27;t have the luxury of trusting repositories,&quot; Meyer says.
Supply Chain Risks
The recent Red Hat breach also showed how many exposed secrets can lead to big risks for downstream customers. Earlier this month, Red Hat Consulting confirmed that threat actors compromised its GitLab instance and accessed thousands of private code repositories. That would have been bad enough, but Crimson Collective, the cybercriminal group behind the breach, also claimed to have stolen customer engagement reports (CERs) for all Red Hat Consulting clients.
According to Crimson Collective&#x27;s Dark Web leak site, the CERs contained client secrets such as access tokens. The group had previously told Dark Reading that it used the secrets to compromise one of Red Hat Consulting&#x27;s customers, but that claim could not be verified.

In another recent example, Wiz found many organizations had exposed secrets in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) marketplaces. While looking for malicious extensions in both Microsoft&#x27;s VS Code Marketplace and the open source alternative Open VSX Registry, the research team discovered more than 550 validated secrets from hundreds of extension publishers.
According to Wiz, the publishers included secrets in extensions packages, which can be easily unzipped and inspected. In many cases, the secrets included access tokens for the marketplaces that would allow a threat actor to tamper with the extensions and potentially conduct massive supply chain attacks. The researchers also noted that many of the secrets were from AI providers — among them, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, XAI, DeepSeek, HuggingFace, and Perplexity — as well as major cloud platforms.
Better Secret Hygiene Needed in the AI Era
&quot;We&#x27;ve seen an increase in exposed secrets this year, though it&#x27;s hard to quantify globally,&quot; says Rami McCarthy, principal security researcher at Wiz.
One contributing factor to the epidemic of secret sprawl is AI, specifically vibe coding platforms. McCarthy says increased adoption of AI coding assistants and generative AI platforms have led to &quot;bad patterns of secrets management,&quot; such as storing plaintext secrets in configuration files.
GitGuardian has seen a continued rise in exposed secrets in recent years. &quot;It&#x27;s getting worse every year, for different reasons,&quot; Carole Winqwist, chief marketing officer (CMO) at GitGuardian, says.
Like McCarthy, Winqwist said AI coding assistants are part of the problem, because these tools often need secrets to connect to other resources, and code is often produced by non-professional developers with little to no security knowledge.
&quot;There is also the problem that more and more code is being produced, and the AI agents are multiplying the volume of secrets that are leveraged by the different systems,&quot; she says. &quot;Also, the [Model Context Protocol] layer is a nightmare of exposure because people are not configuring them correctly.&quot;
Beyond basic security improvements such as strengthening access controls around developer resources and implementing multifactor authentication for all accounts, experts outlined two approaches to help reverse the trend or at least slow it down: practice better secret hygiene and make the secrets themselves less dangerous.
Secret hygiene involves effective monitoring and scanning for secrets in both internal development environments and external resources like application and extension marketplaces. It also requires organizations find and remove secrets that have inadvertently spread to other channels, like Salesforce, because, Valadon says, they are definitely spreading.
&quot;People put secrets in Slack,&quot; he says, &quot;and that&#x27;s a bit crazy.&quot;
Organizations can also limit or even eliminate the damage caused by exposed secrets by using short-term credentials and restricting privileges for tokens and API keys. For example, some organizations use access tokens that are valid only if they are wielded from designated regions or specific IP addresses.
Winqwist says organizations need to stop over-privileging secrets in the first place, which has become a disturbingly common practice among enterprise development teams.
&quot;When they give a key to a system or a third-party, companies tend to over-privilege it because it&#x27;s easier that way. You don&#x27;t have to give it back and it has a long lifespan,&quot; Winqwist says. &quot;The worst is, a lot of organizations use the same key for test environments and production environments. And all of this is malpractice.&quot;

WhatsApp Secures Ban on NSO Group After 6-Year Legal Battle WhatsApp Secures Ban on NSO Group After 6-Year Legal Battle WhatsApp Secures Ban on NSO Group After 6-Year Legal Battle
NSO Group must pay $4 million in damages and is permanently prohibited from reverse-engineering WhatsApp or creating new accounts after targeting users with spyware.
October 22, 2025
In the latest ruling in a lengthy legal battle, commercial spyware company NSO Group was barred from targeting WhatsApp users after hacking into and installing spyware on thousands of devices.
The lawsuit was first filed by WhatsApp against NSO in 2019 after the spyware firm used WhatsApp servers to distribute Pegasus spyware to roughly 1,400 mobile devices through a zero-day vulnerability found in the messaging service&#x27;s systems. Some of the cellular devices infected with the spyware belonged to journalists and activists as well as government officials, diplomats and political candidates.
The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2019-3568, was a buffer overflow bug that allowed remote code execution through a series of RTCP packets sent to a target phone number.
Upon the user receiving these targeted phone calls, the vulnerability was automatically exploited and the spyware then downloaded onto the device.
Meta launched an investigation into the matter before filing a lawsuit in October 2019 arguing that NSO exploited the WhatsApp vulnerability to deliver the Pegasus spyware without consent to Meta users.
In 2024, a judge ruled that NSO Group was liable for the hacking of WhatsApp users&#x27; phones. Earlier this year, a jury ordered the company to pay more than $444,000 in compensatory damages and $167 million in punitive damages .

NSO Group, however, appealed the jury&#x27;s decision and argued WhatsApp shouldn&#x27;t be awarded more than $1.77 million. The spyware company also argued against WhatsApp&#x27;s injunction to prevent NSO from targeting its users, saying that this would put the company at risk and force it out of business.
In a ruling last week, US District Court Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton reduced the punitive damages award to just $4 million but granted Meta&#x27;s request for a permanent injunction against NSO.
The Final Verdict
In the Oct. 17 ruling, Judge Hamilton explained NSO&#x27;s hacking activity posed &quot;direct harm&quot; to both WhatsApp and its users.
&quot;In short, the court granted partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (&quot;CFAA&quot;) and the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (&quot;CDAFA&quot;), as well as for breach of contract,&quot; stated the ruling . &quot;The evidence showed that defendants reverse-engineered WhatsApp&#x27;s code to create a modified version of the Whatsapp client application, which they then used to install their software on target users&#x27; devices via WhatsApp&#x27;s servers.&quot;
Not just this, but additional evidence showed that NSO Group repeatedly redesigned its software to avoid detection and work around WhatsApp&#x27;s security fixes.

Judge Hamilton explained that WhatsApp is essentially selling data privacy to users, and NSO&#x27;s spyware constitutes &quot;irreparable injury&quot; to the company.
&quot;Defendants&#x27; arguments seem to presume the &#x27;right&#x27; to use WhatsApp for their intended purposes, notwithstanding the fact that neither WhatsApp nor the users invited or wanted NSO&#x27;s software on their devices,&quot; the judge wrote.
John Scott-Railton, senior researchers at Citizen Lab , applauded the ruling despite the reduction in punitive damages. &quot;[T]he massive punitive damages jury award against NSO Group ($167m) got reduced by the court, as is expected in cases where it is so large (to 9x compensatory damages),&quot; he wrote in a post on social media platform X. &quot;This is likely cold comfort to NSO since I think the injunction is going to have a huge impact on the value of NSO&#x27;s spyware product.&quot;
Under the permanent injunction, NSO will no longer be able to reverse engineer WhatsApp, nor can it create new accounts on the app. All the WhatsApp source code it possesses must also be deleted and destroyed.
Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp at Meta , also expressed his satisfaction with the ruling in a post on X.

&quot;Today&#x27;s ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again,&quot; wrote Cathcart . &quot;We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society. It sets an important precedent that there are serious consequences to attacking an American company.&quot;

Russia Pivots, Cracks Down on Resident Hackers Russia Pivots, Cracks Down on Resident Hackers Russia Pivots, Cracks Down on Resident Hackers
Thanks to improving cybersecurity and law enforcement action from the West, Russia&#x27;s government is reevaluating which cybercriminals it wants to give safe haven from the law.
October 22, 2025
For the first time in history, the Russian government has been partially cracking down on its cybercriminal underground.
Cybercriminals operate everywhere, but Russia has always been the world&#x27;s epicenter, primarily thanks to the carte blanche they&#x27;re afforded by the state. At best, Russia&#x27;s oligarchy has turned a blind eye to cybercrime within its borders. In many cases, state institutions and powerful officials have actively collaborated with, recruited, and otherwise aided Internet criminals.
In a new report, and an exclusive interview with Dark Reading at its Predict conference in Manhattan in early October, Recorded Future hypothesizes that this symbiosis is starting to show cracks. Thanks to some major developments in the West — namely, increased law enforcement against Russian cybercriminals , and improving cybersecurity across sectors — Russia&#x27;s law enforcement has been revoking the safe harbor it provides some low-level cybercriminals.
&quot;The key finding here is that Russia is acquiescing a little bit to the West,&quot; says Recorded Future threat intelligence analyst Alex Leslie. &quot;You [once] had that unwritten rule of: if I&#x27;m a cyber criminal, as long as I don&#x27;t target Russian organizations and individuals, I won&#x27;t be prosecuted. That has actually changed.&quot;
Related: Tired of Unpaid Toll Texts? Blame the &#x27;Smishing Triad&#x27;
Russia&#x27;s motives for doing this are complex and in some ways cloudy. Regardless, whichever direction it continues will carry staggering implications for global cybersecurity.
The Dark Covenant Between Russia and its Cybercriminals
Russia&#x27;s cybercriminal underground has always been valuable to the Russian state. It&#x27;s a suck on nations adversarial to Russia. It&#x27;s a meaningful and endless source of income for young men without promising job prospects, who might otherwise perform domestic crimes. It&#x27;s a zero-cost talent pipeline for state institutions that run offensive cyber operations. The state can even outsource its operations to high-level criminal groups, affording it a degree of plausible deniability.
For these reasons and more, the Russian powers have always maintained a social contract with lowly hackers: As long as the hackers don&#x27;t attack targets within Russia, they can do whatever they&#x27;d like with impunity. The police won&#x27;t arrest them, and international police won&#x27;t even get a sniff.
In some cases the state doesn&#x27;t just ignore hackers, it works with them. Leaked chats indicate that Conti members have enjoyed private flights with Vladimir Ivanovich Plotnikov, a member of the Russian Duma. One member is known to have supplied the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) with intelligence related to COVID-19. The group has also attacked known targets of the Russian state, whether by coincidence or coordination.

Leslie adds another example. &quot; In the context of Ukraine, the GRU has various layers of institutionalized cybercrime involved. They inform its offensive operations, and have since 2022. Every layer of that institution relies on cybercrime in order to function properly.&quot;
Breaking with the Covenant
It&#x27;s difficult to imagine this dark covenant ever wavering, but developments over the past year indicate that it just might be.
Most notably, in October 2024, Russian authorities raided and arrested nearly 100 people involved with Cryptex and the Universal Automated Payment Service (UAPS), money laundering services for the underground. They seized vehicles, property, and $16 million in Russian rubles.
In an April 2025 case, authorities arrested executives of Aeza Group , a bulletproof hosting provider affiliated with many threat actors and illicit marketplaces. They&#x27;ve also tagged hackers associated with the Mamont banking Trojan, and an anti-corruption official who ironically took bribes from the Infraud Organization cybercrime network.
Even leading members of household ransomware groups like Conti, Lockbit, and REvil have been arrested, though in those cases the flaccid penalties threat actors faced have indicated a lack of seriousness.

This break with precedent is causing serious ripples in the underground. &quot;We see on XSS on Dark Web forums, actors are starting to get scared. Actors are saying: &#x27;I don&#x27;t know if I feel comfortable being on a site like this and speaking Russian anymore.&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t know if I feel comfortable associating with other actors like the initial access brokers (IABs), and the data leak brokers, and the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) providers anymore, that I&#x27;ve been accustomed to working with.&quot;
So why has this been happening?
Operation Endgame: a Game Changer
In May 2024, American and European authorities kicked off Operation Endgame , an unprecedented, large-scale effort to crack down on the people and infrastructure supporting worldwide ransomware operations. Russia&#x27;s crackdown on cybercriminals began a couple of months thereafter.
This may not have been a coincidence. Recorded Future argues that Operation Endgame raised the diplomatic cost of Russia&#x27;s safe harbor policy, and, in a softer sense, extended Western authority while relatively diminishing Russia&#x27;s.
Taking action of its own, by this logic, might have served at least two functions for the Kremlin. Outwardly, if only ostensibly, it demonstrated some desire to curtail cybercrime. Inwardly, it reminded the criminals who&#x27;s boss — &quot;that we have authority over you, that we have power over you, that you will bend to our will. Specifically in terms of offensive operations abroad: you will fold under Russian intelligence services,&quot; Leslie says.
Rather than burn its most useful assets in the underground, however, the Kremlin has pursued a dual-track approach. In essence: sacrificing some pawns to save its queens. Individuals involved in operations irrelevant to state intelligence — for example, money laundering — have faced apparently serious financial and legal penalties. Those of use to the government — leading botnet and ransomware developers from Conti, Trickbot, etc. — have always ultimately been spared by ersatz courtroom trials ending with no real consequences.
The researchers concluded that &quot;these actions appear designed less to dismantle cybercrime writ large than to manage reputational pressure from the West, protect politically connected threat actors, and signal that Russia, not external powers, controls the boundaries of enforcement.&quot;
Russia Targets Russians for Targeting Russians
&quot;What we&#x27;ve noticed, at least since 2022, is an increase in attacks by Russia-based groups on Russian organizations. Ransomware attacks. Spreading malware. Hacktivist groups within Russia targeting Russian organizations,&quot; Leslie says. In this light, it was the cybercriminals who broke the covenant, and the government that responded. &quot;In order for Russia to allow the free market to function, the free market has to have guardrails. And those guardrails, at least within the last two to three years by our measurements, have deteriorated.&quot;
With low confidence, he says, &quot;we speculate that cyber criminal groups are no longer as successful in attacks against Western organizations due to widespread threat intelligence sharing, widespread proliferation of more advanced cybersecurity practices, and cybersecurity regulation .&quot; Between improved law enforcement action and uneven but improving organizational cybersecurity across the Western world, Russian threat actors are reconsidering the much easier targets in their backyards.
Leslie warns that &quot;Russian cybercrime is still flourishing. The Dark Web is still flourishing. That&#x27;s not going to change anytime soon. So I would not recommend any shift in defensive posture whatsoever. What I would recommend is watching very closely how disruptive action scatters the threat landscape, and how you need to adapt and diversify your hunting efforts in order to accommodate.&quot;

Leaked chats indicate that Conti members have enjoyed private flights with Vladimir Ivanovich Plotnikov, a member of the Russian Duma. One member is known to have supplied the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) with intelligence related to COVID-19. The group has also attacked known targets of the Russian state, whether by coincidence or coordination.

Leslie adds another example. &quot; In the context of Ukraine, the GRU has various layers of institutionalized cybercrime involved. They inform its offensive operations, and have since 2022. Every layer of that institution relies on cybercrime in order to function properly.&quot;
Breaking with the Covenant
It&#x27;s difficult to imagine this dark covenant ever wavering, but developments over the past year indicate that it just might be.
Most notably, in October 2024, Russian authorities raided and arrested nearly 100 people involved with Cryptex and the Universal Automated Payment Service (UAPS), money laundering services for the underground. They seized vehicles, property, and $16 million in Russian rubles.
In an April 2025 case, authorities arrested executives of Aeza Group , a bulletproof hosting provider affiliated with many threat actors and illicit marketplaces. They&#x27;ve also tagged hackers associated with the Mamont banking Trojan, and an anti-corruption official who ironically took bribes from the Infraud Organization cybercrime network.
Even leading members of household ransomware groups like Conti, Lockbit, and REvil have been arrested, though in those cases the flaccid penalties threat actors faced have indicated a lack of seriousness.

This break with precedent is causing serious ripples in the underground. &quot;We see on XSS on Dark Web forums, actors are starting to get scared. Actors are saying: &#x27;I don&#x27;t know if I feel comfortable being on a site like this and speaking Russian anymore.&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t know if I feel comfortable associating with other actors like the initial access brokers (IABs), and the data leak brokers, and the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) providers anymore, that I&#x27;ve been accustomed to working with.&quot;
So why has this been happening?
Operation Endgame: a Game Changer
In May 2024, American and European authorities kicked off Operation Endgame , an unprecedented, large-scale effort to crack down on the people and infrastructure supporting worldwide ransomware operations. Russia&#x27;s crackdown on cybercriminals began a couple of months thereafter.
This may not have been a coincidence. Recorded Future argues that Operation Endgame raised the diplomatic cost of Russia&#x27;s safe harbor policy, and, in a softer sense, extended Western authority while relatively diminishing Russia&#x27;s.
Taking action of its own, by this logic, might have served at least two functions for the Kremlin. Outwardly, if only ostensibly, it demonstrated some desire to curtail cybercrime. Inwardly, it reminded the criminals who&#x27;s boss — &quot;that we have authority over you, that we have power over you, that you will bend to our will. Specifically in terms of offensive operations abroad: you will fold under Russian intelligence services,&quot; Leslie says.
Rather than burn its most useful assets in the underground, however, the Kremlin has pursued a dual-track approach. In essence: sacrificing some pawns to save its queens. Individuals involved in operations irrelevant to state intelligence — for example, money laundering — have faced apparently serious financial and legal penalties. Those of use to the government — leading botnet and ransomware developers from Conti, Trickbot, etc. — have always ultimately been spared by ersatz courtroom trials ending with no real consequences.
The researchers concluded that &quot;these actions appear designed less to dismantle cybercrime writ large than to manage reputational pressure from the West, protect politically connected threat actors, and signal that Russia, not external powers, controls the boundaries of enforcement.&quot;
Russia Targets Russians for Targeting Russians
&quot;What we&#x27;ve noticed, at least since 2022, is an increase in attacks by Russia-based groups on Russian organizations. Ransomware attacks. Spreading malware. Hacktivist groups within Russia targeting Russian organizations,&quot; Leslie says. In this light, it was the cybercriminals who broke the covenant, and the government that responded. &quot;In order for Russia to allow the free market to function, the free market has to have guardrails. And those guardrails, at least within the last two to three years by our measurements, have deteriorated.&quot;
With low confidence, he says, &quot;we speculate that cyber criminal groups are no longer as successful in attacks against Western organizations due to widespread threat intelligence sharing, widespread proliferation of more advanced cybersecurity practices, and cybersecurity regulation .&quot; Between improved law enforcement action and uneven but improving organizational cybersecurity across the Western world, Russian threat actors are reconsidering the much easier targets in their backyards.
Leslie warns that &quot;Russian cybercrime is still flourishing. The Dark Web is still flourishing. That&#x27;s not going to change anytime soon. So I would not recommend any shift in defensive posture whatsoever. What I would recommend is watching very closely how disruptive action scatters the threat landscape, and how you need to adapt and diversify your hunting efforts in order to accommodate.&quot;

MuddyWater Targets 100+ Gov Entities in MEA With Phoenix Backdoor MuddyWater Targets 100+ Gov Entities in MEA With Phoenix Backdoor MuddyWater Targets 100+ Gov Entities in MEA With Phoenix Backdoor
The Iranian threat group is using a compromised mailbox accessed through NordVPN to send phishing emails that prompt recipients to enable macros.
October 22, 2025
The Iran-backed threat group known as MuddyWater is targeting more than 100 government-related organizations and other entities across the Middle East and North Africa in a cyberespionage campaign that delivers a custom backdoor through phishing emails.
Cybersecurity vendor Group-IB discovered the campaign, which began on Aug. 19 and uses a compromised mailbox that attackers accessed through the legitimate VPN service NordVPN , giving its malicious emails an appearance of authenticity, researchers revealed in a blog post published today.
&quot;By exploiting the trust and authority associated with such communications, the campaign significantly increased its chances of deceiving recipients into opening the malicious attachments,&quot; Group IB Malware Analyst Mahmoud Zohdy and Cyber Intelligence Analyst Mansour Alhmoud wrote in the post.
The ultimate payload of the campaign is version 4 of the Phoenix backdoor , which is exclusively used by MuddyWater and was dropped via another custom malware, a FakeUpdate injector, the analysts said. The goal of the campaign is to establish persistence and connect with MuddyWater&#x27;s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure for intelligence gathering and remote monitoring, according to Group-IB.
Macros Required for Execution

MuddyWater — also known as APT34, Helix Kitten, Seedworm, TA450, and OilRig , among other names — is an Iranian threat group active since at least 2017 that has been linked to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). The group is aimed at cyberespionage and geopolitical disruption , and has made a significant resurgence in the past couple of years, armed with custom malware and stealth tactics that allowed it to lurk undetected on the system of an unnamed Middle Eastern government in 2023.
In the newest campaign tracked by Group-IB, MuddyWater is targeting mainly government entities such as embassies, diplomatic missions, foreign affairs ministries, and consulates both in the Middle East and Africa. &quot;Several targeted recipients are part of well-known global institutions that focus on international cooperation and humanitarian work,&quot; the researchers wrote. &quot;This supports the group’s larger geopolitical goals and the purposeful nature of its targeting.&quot;
Victims receive phishing emails that contain intentionally blurred Microsoft Word documents and prompts them to enable macros in order to view the content. As soon as macros are activated, the documents execute malicious Visual Basic for Application (VBA) code, functioning as a dropper that decodes and writes a loader to disk before executing it.
Related: China-Nexus Actors Weaponize &#x27;Nezha&#x27; Open Source Tool
The loader used in the process is FakeUpdate, an injector-style tool that decrypts an embedded second-stage payload using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and injects it into its own process. This activity ultimately leads to the deployment of the Phoenix backdoor on victim machines.
Custom Malware Points to Perpetrator
Group-IB identified the perpetrator of the campaign as MuddyWater because both the FakeUpdate loader and Phoenix backdoor are used exclusively by the threat group, the analysts noted in the post.
Once executed, version 4 of the Phoenix backdoor creates a mutex (sysprocupdate.exe) to set up a unique process and then gathers host and system information. It then copies itself to C:\ProgramData\sysprocupdate.exe and establishes persistence by modifying the Windows Registry. The backdoor ultimately communicates with C2 over WinHTTP to receive and execute commands from MuddyWater.
Other malware used in the campaign include Chromium_Stealer, a custom credential stealer disguised as a calculator app, and the remote monitoring and management tools PDQ RMM and Action1, which MuddyWater is using for remote control and persistence.
Strengthen Defenses Against State-Sponsored Actors
Related: Android Spyware in the UAE Masquerades as ... Spyware
MuddyWater and similar state-aligned actors are consistently targeting government entities and critical infrastructure providers in their attempts to gather intelligence and create disruption, respectively. For this reason, Group-IB is urging organizations to strengthen defenses against these actors in a number of ways.
These measures include subscribing to trusted threat intelligence feeds to receive up-to-date indicators of compromise (IoCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to MuddyWater, as the group consistently changes its tactics and malware. Defenders also as should conduct continuous threat hunting for indicators associated with Phoenix, FakeUpdate, and other malicious infrastructure and tools related to the group.
Organizations also can enhance email and phishing defenses by deploying sandboxing and attachment scanning for Office documents, flagging those with embedded macros or suspicious VBA code given its use in MuddyWater&#x27;s latest campaign, the analysts said. They also should, as a general rule, conduct regular phishing simulations and awareness training for personnel, emphasizing &quot;enable content&quot; macro lures like the ones employed in this campaign.
Another way organizations can shore up their defensive posture is to implement endpoint and access controls such as disabling Office macros by default through Group Policy and allowing execution only from signed or trusted sources. They also should deploy and tune EDR/XDR solutions to detect PowerShell misuse, process injection, and abnormal auto registry modifications, as well as enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) across all accounts to prevent unauthorized mailbox access, according to Group-IB.

Verizon: Mobile Blindspot Leads to Needless Data Breaches Verizon: Mobile Blindspot Leads to Needless Data Breaches Verizon: Mobile Blindspot Leads to Needless Data Breaches
People habitually ignore cybersecurity on their phones. Instead of compensating for that, organizations are falling into the very same trap, even though available security options could cut smishing success and breaches in half.
October 22, 2025
Enterprise cybersecurity risks from employees using their personal phones for work are rising, but companies aren&#x27;t adopting solutions quickly enough to account for them.
The data collected in Verizon Business&#x27; 2025 Mobile Security Index (MSI) paints a clear picture of an often overlooked organizational security risk. People are being hacked on their personal phones, then transmitting those attacks to their employers. Their employers, though, aren&#x27;t addressing the issue with the same verve they are desktop-borne risks.
On top of that, the mobile security solutions they&#x27;re ignoring are actually proving to be effective, at both reducing the success rate of attacks and reducing the consequences of those attacks that get through.
Mobile Phone Cyberattacks, Smishing on the Rise
Have you been getting a lot of texts about unpaid tolls , expiring offers, or freelance job opportunities lately?
Chris Novak, Verizon Business&#x27;s vice president of global cybersecurity solutions, suggests that hackers have hit on something: for now, at least, smishing is more effective than email phishing. For one thing, &quot;people tend to be more trusting of these devices. And as a result, they&#x27;re more likely to click on links and follow through&quot; with the phishing logic.
Related: Tired of Unpaid Toll Texts? Blame the &#x27;Smishing Triad&#x27;
Another factor, he adds, &quot;is that smishing attacks have far less context to them. We&#x27;ve all become accustomed to what an email looks like. We&#x27;ve started to be able to tell when an email looks like it&#x27;s malicious. Whereas when phishing messages come over text, there&#x27;s usually very low [awareness]. As a result, even a poorly messaged smishing tends to be more believable than even a well-messaged phish.&quot;
Eighty percent of organizations surveyed as part of the 2025 MSI reported attempted smishing attacks against their employees. Perhaps not so coincidentally, 80% also reported having tested their employees with smishing simulations. But while employees tend to fail phishing simulations around roughly 10% of the time — less or more often depending on a variety of factors — only 10% of companies reported that 10% or fewer of their employees fell for smishing tests. In two out of every five companies, between one quarter and one half of all employees failed their smishing tests. In 9% of companies, more than half of all employees failed.
Beyond smishing versus phishing, people generally just disregard mobile security in a way they never would with their laptops. On an individual level, Novak says, &quot;people continue to do all the things that we recommend against, on mobile devices. They&#x27;re storing passwords in their Notes app. Things like that.&quot;
Related: Russia Pivots, Cracks Down on Resident Hackers
He recalls, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard people say this, and it always makes me cringe: if they&#x27;re not sure if they should open something or click on something, they&#x27;ll do it from their phone. And that&#x27;s because they believe nothing can happen there. So I think there&#x27;s still a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation that they don&#x27;t need to apply security in the same manner as they would with the rest of their [devices].&quot;
Cyber Threats to Personal and Work Phones Go Unaddressed
Organizations could address pressing mobile security risks with commensurate mitigations. But most aren&#x27;t.
Employers issue work computers at a far greater rate than they do work phones. In 2023, Samsung found that shy of 50% of companies provide some work phones to select employees, and only 15% issue work phones for all employees . It&#x27;s no surprise, then, that 70% of mobile cyberattacks reported in the 2025 MSI affected personal phones, not work ones.
Even work phones have their risks, though. The one thing that saves companies from phishing attacks is that they occur in relatively controlled environments: on work computers, connected to the company network, at certain times of day, in sight of whatever security tools they have in place. &quot;But lots of people carry their mobile work devices with them even when they&#x27;re off hours, when they&#x27;re on holiday,&quot; Novak points out. Work phones outside of work are subject to many of the same vulnerabilities personal phones are, and &quot;it means that they can be reached at any point in time. It may also present opportunities to hit them at points in time where, you know, their judgment may be impaired — they may be distracted by something, they may have other things going on.&quot;

Verizon&#x27;s 2025 MSI posits eight categories of mobile security best practices: performing risk analyses, adhering to a zero-trust philosophy, implementing mobile device management (MDM), etc. In combination, the authors argue, the benefits are drastic. Organizations with all eight are half as likely to experience breaches that cause system downtime (24% to 46%), and they&#x27;re less than one fifth as likely to experience &quot;major repercussions&quot; (12%, compared with 63% of those without all eight).
&quot;A lot of organizations we see have heavily invested in the security of their laptops, desktops, servers,&quot; Novak says. &quot;They&#x27;ve got all sorts of tooling and technology to monitor and gather telemetry of what&#x27;s happening in that part of their environment. I think organizations are still struggling to get to parity on their mobile security. As a result, there&#x27;s a lower ability for many of them to detect when an event has occurred. The time to detection typically is a little bit longer, and the ability for them to more readily address the issue can be more challenging.&quot;

After a particularly gruesome murder, South Korea issues &quot;code black&quot; travel ban for several regions in Cambodia, while other nations urge more raids.
October 22, 2025
Human trafficking and forced-labor camps where the equivalent of indentured servants carry out scams, fraud, and other cybercrime activities have infested Cambodia, Laos, and Burma — and neighboring Asian nations are taking more stringent efforts to deal with the growing problem.
Last week, South Korea banned travel to parts of Cambodia, stating that citizens can be prosecuted for violating the law and &quot;strongly advised&quot; them to cancel their trips, in what the government refers to as a &quot;code black&quot; travel ban. The South Korean government, which estimates that about 1,000 citizens are working or forced to work in the cyber-scam centers, is also reportedly readying sanctions against the groups operating in Cambodia and other cybercrime-friendly nations.
The actions come following the August discovery of a 22-year-old South Korean student who was lured to a scam center and found dead with signs of torture.
&quot;A considerable number of South Koreans are also thought to be employed there — while the exact figure is difficult to verify, domestic authorities generally estimate the number at around 1,000,&quot; National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac told reporters, according to the DW news service .
The cybercrime centers have been phenomenally successful, ensnaring hundreds of thousands of workers and raking in tens of billions of dollars every year from victims in the US, the European Union, Canada, and other nations. In September, the US government sanctioned nearly a score of individuals and organizations that profited from the fraud operations and operated in Cambodia and Burma, often referred to as Myanmar.

Yet, these efforts have largely failed to prevent the growth of the cybercrime syndicates behind the cyber-scam centers, says Frankie Sclafani, director of cybersecurity enablement at Deepwatch, a cyber-resilience platform.
&quot;Despite intensified crackdowns by regional nations, the problem is growing,&quot; he says. &quot;The syndicates are adapting rapidly by embracing advanced technology, specifically artificial intelligence (AI) ... [and] shifting their operations to decentralized infrastructure, such as satellite Internet, to evade disruption.&quot;
Alerts and Condemnation
A number of other Asian nations — including India and the Philippines — have begun taking more forceful steps against Cambodia, with India calling for greater efforts to repatriate its citizens and the Philippines warning of increasing fraudulent offers of employment to Filipinos as &quot;customer service representatives.&quot;

In July, requests from several government ministries in India lead to the Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet issuing director orders for law enforcement and military officials to act against multiple cyber-fraud compounds inside the nation&#x27;s border, resulting in the arrest of more than 3,000 individuals across 138 sites, including more than 1,000 Chinese nationals, 693 Vietnamese, 366 Indonesians, and 105 Indians.
Others have squarely blamed the Cambodian government. In a research report based on interviews with 58 survivors of the cybercrime compounds, analysis of 365 victim records, and visits to 52 compounds, Amnesty International found human trafficking, torture for not meeting targets, measures to prevent victims from leaving, and the selling of victims between compounds.
&quot;Deceived, trafficked, and enslaved, the survivors of these scamming compounds describe being trapped in a living nightmare — enlisted in criminal enterprises that are operating with the apparent consent of the Cambodian government,&quot; Amnesty International&#x27;s Secretary General Agnès Callamard said in the report published in June .
Cambodia&#x27;s government called the report &quot;exaggerated,&quot; according to Reuters .
Beyond the Golden Triangle
While the cybercrime fraud centers are flourishing in the former Golden Triangle of Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar, they are already spreading quickly. A United Nations report found that the cybercriminal syndicates behind the cyber-scam centers had already started becoming less regional by expanding to areas like Africa.

Any region with inexperienced law enforcement or lax legal frameworks will likely be targeted as new homes for these efforts, says Justin Endres, head of data security at Seclore, an enterprise cybersecurity firm.
&quot;The model is spreading to Africa and Latin America, where weak regulation, cheap infrastructure, and rising crypto activity create fertile ground,&quot; he says, adding that governments and companies need to get ahead of the threat. &quot;The fight ahead is about controlling the information these criminal networks exploit before they turn the developing world into their next digital battlefield.&quot;
In addition, nations should redouble their efforts to sanction the profits and prosecute the individuals behind the cybercrimes, says Deepwatch&#x27;s Sclafani.
&quot;To effectively combat the syndicates, global leaders must focus on coordinated international action that targets the criminal financial networks through sanctions and cryptocurrency forfeitures,&quot; he says. &quot;As a society, if we want to stamp out these criminals for good, we must strengthen legal frameworks to regulate new technologies and address the high levels of political corruption that allow these &#x27;scam factories&#x27; to continue to operate with impunity.&quot;

After a particularly gruesome murder, South Korea issues &quot;code black&quot; travel ban for several regions in Cambodia, while other nations urge more raids.
October 22, 2025
Human trafficking and forced-labor camps where the equivalent of indentured servants carry out scams, fraud, and other cybercrime activities have infested Cambodia, Laos, and Burma — and neighboring Asian nations are taking more stringent efforts to deal with the growing problem.
Last week, South Korea banned travel to parts of Cambodia, stating that citizens can be prosecuted for violating the law and &quot;strongly advised&quot; them to cancel their trips, in what the government refers to as a &quot;code black&quot; travel ban. The South Korean government, which estimates that about 1,000 citizens are working or forced to work in the cyber-scam centers, is also reportedly readying sanctions against the groups operating in Cambodia and other cybercrime-friendly nations.
The actions come following the August discovery of a 22-year-old South Korean student who was lured to a scam center and found dead with signs of torture.
&quot;A considerable number of South Koreans are also thought to be employed there — while the exact figure is difficult to verify, domestic authorities generally estimate the number at around 1,000,&quot; National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac told reporters, according to the DW news service .
The cybercrime centers have been phenomenally successful, ensnaring hundreds of thousands of workers and raking in tens of billions of dollars every year from victims in the US, the European Union, Canada, and other nations. In September, the US government sanctioned nearly a score of individuals and organizations that profited from the fraud operations and operated in Cambodia and Burma, often referred to as Myanmar.

Yet, these efforts have largely failed to prevent the growth of the cybercrime syndicates behind the cyber-scam centers, says Frankie Sclafani, director of cybersecurity enablement at Deepwatch, a cyber-resilience platform.
&quot;Despite intensified crackdowns by regional nations, the problem is growing,&quot; he says. &quot;The syndicates are adapting rapidly by embracing advanced technology, specifically artificial intelligence (AI) ... [and] shifting their operations to decentralized infrastructure, such as satellite Internet, to evade disruption.&quot;
Alerts and Condemnation
A number of other Asian nations — including India and the Philippines — have begun taking more forceful steps against Cambodia, with India calling for greater efforts to repatriate its citizens and the Philippines warning of increasing fraudulent offers of employment to Filipinos as &quot;customer service representatives.&quot;

In July, requests from several government ministries in India lead to the Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet issuing director orders for law enforcement and military officials to act against multiple cyber-fraud compounds inside the nation&#x27;s border, resulting in the arrest of more than 3,000 individuals across 138 sites, including more than 1,000 Chinese nationals, 693 Vietnamese, 366 Indonesians, and 105 Indians.
Others have squarely blamed the Cambodian government. In a research report based on interviews with 58 survivors of the cybercrime compounds, analysis of 365 victim records, and visits to 52 compounds, Amnesty International found human trafficking, torture for not meeting targets, measures to prevent victims from leaving, and the selling of victims between compounds.
&quot;Deceived, trafficked, and enslaved, the survivors of these scamming compounds describe being trapped in a living nightmare — enlisted in criminal enterprises that are operating with the apparent consent of the Cambodian government,&quot; Amnesty International&#x27;s Secretary General Agnès Callamard said in the report published in June .
Cambodia&#x27;s government called the report &quot;exaggerated,&quot; according to Reuters .
Beyond the Golden Triangle
While the cybercrime fraud centers are flourishing in the former Golden Triangle of Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar, they are already spreading quickly. A United Nations report found that the cybercriminal syndicates behind the cyber-scam centers had already started becoming less regional by expanding to areas like Africa.

Any region with inexperienced law enforcement or lax legal frameworks will likely be targeted as new homes for these efforts, says Justin Endres, head of data security at Seclore, an enterprise cybersecurity firm.
&quot;The model is spreading to Africa and Latin America, where weak regulation, cheap infrastructure, and rising crypto activity create fertile ground,&quot; he says, adding that governments and companies need to get ahead of the threat. &quot;The fight ahead is about controlling the information these criminal networks exploit before they turn the developing world into their next digital battlefield.&quot;
In addition, nations should redouble their efforts to sanction the profits and prosecute the individuals behind the cybercrimes, says Deepwatch&#x27;s Sclafani.
&quot;To effectively combat the syndicates, global leaders must focus on coordinated international action that targets the criminal financial networks through sanctions and cryptocurrency forfeitures,&quot; he says. &quot;As a society, if we want to stamp out these criminals for good, we must strengthen legal frameworks to regulate new technologies and address the high levels of political corruption that allow these &#x27;scam factories&#x27; to continue to operate with impunity.&quot;

Electronic Warfare Puts Commercial GPS Users on Notice Electronic Warfare Puts Commercial GPS Users on Notice Electronic Warfare Puts Commercial GPS Users on Notice
Interference with the global positioning system (GPS) isn&#x27;t just a problem for airlines, but for shipping, trucking, car navigation, agriculture, and even the financial sector.
October 21, 2025
Localized jamming and spoofing of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) continues to be a hallmark of conflicts across the globe, with the digital signal attacks impacting air travel and transport and maritime shipping. And now, the denial-of-service issue seems to be affecting everyday organizations in other verticals, too.
The level of interference coming from Russia is particularly significant. In early October, after documenting more than 122,000 flights affected by GNSS interference in the first four months of 2025 — and an incident involving European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen&#x27;s airplane on Sept. 1 — delegates attending the latest United Nation&#x27;s civil aviation agency assembly voted to condemn Russia&#x27;s widespread interference and spoofing of GNSS signals in the region. The assembly also condemned North Korea for similar activity.
Overall, GNSS interference has increased from around 700 daily incidents in 2024 to more than 1,000 daily incidents this year . The number of incidents is steadily increasing, says Todd Humphreys, a professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University of Texas and the director of the Radionavigation Laboratory .
&quot;By now we&#x27;ve had our wakeup call on the issue of GPS interference,&quot; he says. &quot;It has long been viewed as a good idea to harden aviation, maritime, and communications against GPS jamming and spoofing. Now it&#x27;s an imperative.&quot;
Related: How CISA Layoffs Weaken Civilian Cyber Defense
Yet, other industries have also suffered from disruptions as well, due to the reliance of a wide variety of services on the location-and-timing technology. In Finland, for example, areas of farms are reportedly &quot;unfarmable&quot; using GNSS-based tractors and combines because of the interference from Russian electronic warfare (EW) installations.
Solar activity is another cause of global positioning system (GPS) and GNSS interference and a May 2024 incident underscored that about 70% of US agricultural production could be impacted by a sustained outage.
Expanding Satellite Jamming Attack Landscape
GNSS interference has become commonplace for airplanes and maritime shipping in regions of military conflict or heightened geopolitical tensions, including along Russia&#x27;s border with Europe and Ukraine, Israeli and Palestinian territory, and over Cambodia and Myanmar. In 2025, about 1,000 daily incidents of GPS interference — either spoofing or jamming — have occurred globally, according SkAI Data Services, which tracks the incidents using open source data.

GNSS jammers are inexpensive, so the number of actors using them is increasing, says Raphael Monstein, co-founder of SkAI Data Services.
&quot;It&#x27;s noticeable around conflicts, and this is not limited&quot; to only the major ones, he says. &quot;[Not just] everywhere around Russia, but on the border of Pakistan and India. We actually see it every day in Myanmar. ... There was huge protests in Serbia where we saw spoofing, but just for a couple of hours, and similar incidents on the North-South Korean border and around Macau.&quot;
Little wonder, then, that the technology has impacted other industries as well — and far away from these conflict zones. The GNSS and the original US-created global positioning system have become critical services that companies and industries rely upon for location and timing information.
In tandem, the disruption and spoofing techniques have made it into the toolboxes of cyber-enabled criminals as well, with attacks on technology a frequent characteristic of cargo theft and supply chain attacks . Thieves can use GPS disruption to prevent authorities from finding cargo containers until any location devices are disabled, or use a trio of technologies — GPS, Voice over IP, and synthetic identities — to enable fraud throughout the supply chain by donning the guise of a customer or shipper. In 2025, value of stolen cargo is expected to rise 22%, with that trio of technologies enabling the increase in crime, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB).
Related: International Sting Takes Down SIM Box Criminal Network
The financial industry uses GNSS as well to track ATM machines, especially valuable after the dozens of times each year a physical machine is stolen. Banks can use GPS to lead law enforcement to the stolen devices.
Updated Hack-Resistant GPS Infrastructure, New Approaches
A variety of new technologies has been proposed to mitigate the threat, from gyroscopes-on-a-chip to laser-based technologies that are immune to interference. In a September letter , the GPS Innovation Alliance, which consists of industries reliant on global positioning technology, called for the Trump administration to support investment to create alternatives.
&quot;Jamming, spoofing, and other intentional disruptions to GPS pose a serious threat to safety, security, and reliability,&quot; said National Business Aviation Association president and CEO Ed Bolen, who joined with the GPSIA to call for &quot;government leaders to work together on upgrades, investments, and other approaches for hardening the technology from interference by nefarious actors.&quot;
The administration appears to be amenable to funding research and development into alternatives. In a March letter , Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, called for the exploration of other positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems.
&quot;While GPS may be indispensable, it is not infallible,&quot; he stated in a March letter. &quot;Continuing to rely so heavily on one system leaves us exposed. Disruptions to GPS have the potential to undermine the nation&#x27;s economic and national security. And the risks to our current system are only increasing.&quot;

Fraudsters are using generative AI to generate fake music and boost the popularity of the fake content.
October 21, 2025
Discussion abounds about how attackers could potentially use artificial intelligence (AI) to craft their attacks. The latest research from Human Security&#x27;s Satori Threat Intelligence team shows how bad actors are using generative AI to mass produce royalty-eligible music and ghost artists to collect and launder royalties.
This is streaming fraud, where bad actors play tracks on loop — but no real audience is listening — and collect royalties. Streaming fraud requires bad actors to create content and then generate seemingly authentic traffic with fake engagement, such as likes, views, comments, and clicks. To be successful, the fraudsters have to generate content at scale and generate large amounts of seemingly authentic traffic to the streams. Rightsholders (usually the artist or the content creator) typically are paid $0.003 to $0.005 per play, but these minuscule payments can add up, especially when fraudsters harness AI to generate millions of tracks and use botnets to generate traffic.
Generative AI is making it easy for fraudsters to create thousands of unique, royalty-eligible tracks in minutes, turning stream fraud from &quot;a niche scheme into a large-scale operation,&quot; wrote Inna Vasilyeva, senior threat intel analyst and reverse engineer at Human Security, in a research post . &quot;Last year, billions of music streams were consumed by bots, diverting millions in royalties away from real artists.&quot;

Fraudsters are creating large playlists of generated tracks under dozens of fake artist names, where each track is slightly different. Then they&#x27;re uploading the tracks to major streaming platforms, such as Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube, using digital distribution services, says Vasilyeva in an interview with Dark Reading. The Satori team found hundreds of thousands of AI-generated songs, some with lyrics and some instrumental, and podcasts. The podcasts are often bot voices reading scraped online text. Fraudsters are also uploading AI videos, often with generic stock music or AI-generated narration.
The music itself is bland and repetitive, Vasilyeva notes, since the goal is to just generate a stream and not actually be good .
&quot;There is so much opportunity for attackers to target this space,&quot; she says.
Once the content exists, the next step is to use botnets, fake accounts (or account takeovers of legitimate accounts), click farms, and proxies to generate fake traffic and engagement. Fraudulent streams are often used to artificially boost the ranking of a song or video on popular playlists (such as &quot;Raindy Day Lo-Fi,&quot; or workout playlists, for example). The fraudsters use listener farms to drive traffic to these playlists, tricking the streaming platform&#x27;s algorithm into recommending the AI-generated content to real users. The botnets employ residential proxies, virtual private networks (VPNs), and Selenium/Puppeteer tools to create fraudulent activity that appear as streams originating from different IP addresses across geographic locations. Fraudsters are also using AI to manage the bot networks, such as automating the process of rotating through proxies and VPNs and spoofing digital identities, notes Vasilyeva.

The Satori team describes a few ways to identify when the content or stream is being used for streaming fraud, such as when the artist exists only on the platform and has no discernible Web presence. Other signs include the artist having a bare-bones profile page on the streaming platform or being linked to production companies or labels specializing in generic &quot;mood music.&quot; Vasilyeva cited Firefly Entertainment and Epidemic Sound as examples in the research post.
More importantly, actual streaming platform data can identify potential artificial streaming activity. Sudden, unexplained spikes with abrupt drop-offs in traffic that do not correlate with any promotional activity, press coverage, social media trend, or other real-world event is a good example of bot-driven traffic.

Such tactics are not unique to the music industry, says Lindsay Kaye, vice president of threat intelligence at Human Security. Using botnets to push AI-generated materials to create fake ad traffic or misleading people into thinking the content and creators they are engaging with are real are issues that other industries also have to deal with. In many cases, organizations looking at bot detection may not be seeing the full picture of how fraudsters are employing AI and other tools to drive their fraud campaigns.

‘PassiveNeuron’ Cyber Spies Target Orgs With Custom Malware ‘PassiveNeuron’ Cyber Spies Target Orgs With Custom Malware ‘PassiveNeuron’ Cyber Spies Target Orgs With Custom Malware
A persistent cyber-espionage campaign focused on SQL servers is targeting government, industrial, and financial sectors across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
October 21, 2025
A threat campaign is targeting high-profile organizations in the government, industrial, and financial sectors across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, with two custom malware implants designed for cyber espionage .
Dubbed &quot;PassiveNeuron,&quot; the campaign has resurfaced after its initial discovery in June 2024 by researchers at Kaspersky, who detailed a new wave of related infections between December 2024 and August 2025 in a blog post published today.
The campaign specifically compromises servers of Windows-based organizations with custom malware called &quot;Neursite&quot; and &quot;NeuralExecutor,&quot; which are a C++ modular backdoor and an implant for running additional .NET payloads, respectively. Neither malware was identified previously in other threat campaigns, according to Kaspersky. Attackers also deploy Cobalt Strike , the commercial red-teaming tool commonly used by threat actors, as a payload.
Moreover, the campaign&#x27;s targeting of servers is noteworthy, suggesting advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, according to the post. &quot;These servers, especially the ones exposed to the Internet, are usually lucrative targets for APTs, as they can serve as entry points into target organizations,&quot; Kaspersky security experts Georgy Kucherin and Saurabh Sharma wrote in the post.

Analysis of one infection case suggests that attackers are going after Microsoft SQL Server software in particular, as the researchers observed attackers gaining initial remote command execution capabilities on the compromised server through SQL Server.
Though the researchers did not observe exactly how the software was compromised, typically attackers hack these servers through exploitation of vulnerabilities on the server itself or through SQL injection flaws present in the applications running on the server, they said. Attackers also can gain access to SQL Server by brute-forcing the passwords of or otherwise gaining access to the database administration account and using it to execute malicious SQL queries, the researchers said.
Who&#x27;s Behind the PassiveNeuron Campaign?
Without previous identification of either malware, attribution for the campaign has been difficult for the researchers, they said. Initial clues suggested that Russia-backed threat actors might be responsible, with names of all functions for NeuralExecutor samples observed in 2024 replaced with strings prefixed with &quot;Супер обфускатор,&quot; which is Russian for &quot;Super obfuscator.&quot;
However, the attackers deliberately introduced this string while using the ConfuserEx obfuscator, which means it could have been intended to throw researchers off the trail of the true attackers, Kucherin and Sharma said. &quot;That is because threat actors may insert strings in languages they do not speak, in order to create false flags intended to confuse researchers and incident responders and prompt them to make an error of judgement when trying to attribute the threat,&quot; they wrote in the post.

Eventually, the researchers found various clues that they believe link the activity to China-backed threat actors , particularly due to the way malware samples used in 2025 attacks retrieved command-and-control (C2) server addresses.
&quot;While the 2024 samples were designed to retrieve the C2 server addresses straight from the configuration, the 2025 ones did so by using the Dead Drop Resolver technique ,&quot; the researchers wrote. The technique uses an existing, legitimate external Web service — in this case GitHub — to host information that points to C2 infrastructure.
&quot;It is notable that this exact method of obtaining C2 server addresses from GitHub, using a string containing delimiter sequences, is quite popular among Chinese-speaking threat actors,&quot; specifically those tied to the previous EastWind campaign, they wrote.

Moreover, the overall TTPs of the PassiveNeuron campaign most resemble the ones commonly employed by Chinese-speaking threat actors, the researchers added. For these reasons, they attributed the PassiveNeuron campaign &quot;with a low level of confidence&quot; to a Chinese-speaking threat actor.
Custom Malware Analysis
Of the three payloads dropped in the campaign, the Neursite backdoor is the most potent one, the researchers noted. The implant can use the TCP, SSL, HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C2 communications, connecting to the C2 server directly or waiting for another machine to start communicating through a specified port.
&quot;In cases we observed, Neursite samples were configured to use either external servers or compromised internal infrastructure for C2 communications,&quot; the researchers said. The default commands implemented inside the backdoor allow attackers to retrieve system information, manage running processes, or proxy traffic through other machines infected with the Neursite implant to facilitate lateral movement.
Neursite also has a component that allows loading supplementary plug-ins, some of which allow for shell command execution, file system management, and TCP socket operations, they said.
The custom NeuralExecutor loader, meanwhile, implements multiple methods of network communication — namely TCP, HTTP/HTTPS, named pipes, and WebSockets. Upon establishing a communication channel with the C2 server, the backdoor can receive commands allowing it to load .NET assemblies, with its main capability being to receive additional .NET payloads from the network and execute them.
Protecting Servers from Compromise
APTs are consistently looking for ways to compromise the internal systems of targeted organizations for cyber espionage in ways that allow them to conduct persistent monitoring and exfiltration of data. High-profile China-backed actors are particularly active in this regard with a number of persistent and aggressive cyber-espionage campaigns spanning the globe at any given time.
Given that PassiveNeuron targets server machines in high-profile organizations, it&#x27;s critical that defenders pay close attention to their protection and reduce their attack surface wherever possible, as well as monitor all server applications to prevent emerging infections, the researchers said.
Due to the campaign&#x27;s targeting of SQL servers in particular, organizations also should secure applications against SQL injection flaws, which are commonly exploited by threat actors to obtain initial access, they noted. Organizations also should shore up defenses against Web shells, which attackers also often deploy to facilitate compromise of servers, the researchers added.

‘PassiveNeuron’ Cyber Spies Target Orgs With Custom Malware ‘PassiveNeuron’ Cyber Spies Target Orgs With Custom Malware ‘PassiveNeuron’ Cyber Spies Target Orgs With Custom Malware
A persistent cyber-espionage campaign focused on SQL servers is targeting government, industrial, and financial sectors across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
October 21, 2025
A threat campaign is targeting high-profile organizations in the government, industrial, and financial sectors across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, with two custom malware implants designed for cyber espionage .
Dubbed &quot;PassiveNeuron,&quot; the campaign has resurfaced after its initial discovery in June 2024 by researchers at Kaspersky, who detailed a new wave of related infections between December 2024 and August 2025 in a blog post published today.
The campaign specifically compromises servers of Windows-based organizations with custom malware called &quot;Neursite&quot; and &quot;NeuralExecutor,&quot; which are a C++ modular backdoor and an implant for running additional .NET payloads, respectively. Neither malware was identified previously in other threat campaigns, according to Kaspersky. Attackers also deploy Cobalt Strike , the commercial red-teaming tool commonly used by threat actors, as a payload.
Moreover, the campaign&#x27;s targeting of servers is noteworthy, suggesting advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, according to the post. &quot;These servers, especially the ones exposed to the Internet, are usually lucrative targets for APTs, as they can serve as entry points into target organizations,&quot; Kaspersky security experts Georgy Kucherin and Saurabh Sharma wrote in the post.

Analysis of one infection case suggests that attackers are going after Microsoft SQL Server software in particular, as the researchers observed attackers gaining initial remote command execution capabilities on the compromised server through SQL Server.
Though the researchers did not observe exactly how the software was compromised, typically attackers hack these servers through exploitation of vulnerabilities on the server itself or through SQL injection flaws present in the applications running on the server, they said. Attackers also can gain access to SQL Server by brute-forcing the passwords of or otherwise gaining access to the database administration account and using it to execute malicious SQL queries, the researchers said.
Who&#x27;s Behind the PassiveNeuron Campaign?
Without previous identification of either malware, attribution for the campaign has been difficult for the researchers, they said. Initial clues suggested that Russia-backed threat actors might be responsible, with names of all functions for NeuralExecutor samples observed in 2024 replaced with strings prefixed with &quot;Супер обфускатор,&quot; which is Russian for &quot;Super obfuscator.&quot;
However, the attackers deliberately introduced this string while using the ConfuserEx obfuscator, which means it could have been intended to throw researchers off the trail of the true attackers, Kucherin and Sharma said. &quot;That is because threat actors may insert strings in languages they do not speak, in order to create false flags intended to confuse researchers and incident responders and prompt them to make an error of judgement when trying to attribute the threat,&quot; they wrote in the post.

Eventually, the researchers found various clues that they believe link the activity to China-backed threat actors , particularly due to the way malware samples used in 2025 attacks retrieved command-and-control (C2) server addresses.
&quot;While the 2024 samples were designed to retrieve the C2 server addresses straight from the configuration, the 2025 ones did so by using the Dead Drop Resolver technique ,&quot; the researchers wrote. The technique uses an existing, legitimate external Web service — in this case GitHub — to host information that points to C2 infrastructure.
&quot;It is notable that this exact method of obtaining C2 server addresses from GitHub, using a string containing delimiter sequences, is quite popular among Chinese-speaking threat actors,&quot; specifically those tied to the previous EastWind campaign, they wrote.

Moreover, the overall TTPs of the PassiveNeuron campaign most resemble the ones commonly employed by Chinese-speaking threat actors, the researchers added. For these reasons, they attributed the PassiveNeuron campaign &quot;with a low level of confidence&quot; to a Chinese-speaking threat actor.
Custom Malware Analysis
Of the three payloads dropped in the campaign, the Neursite backdoor is the most potent one, the researchers noted. The implant can use the TCP, SSL, HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C2 communications, connecting to the C2 server directly or waiting for another machine to start communicating through a specified port.
&quot;In cases we observed, Neursite samples were configured to use either external servers or compromised internal infrastructure for C2 communications,&quot; the researchers said. The default commands implemented inside the backdoor allow attackers to retrieve system information, manage running processes, or proxy traffic through other machines infected with the Neursite implant to facilitate lateral movement.
Neursite also has a component that allows loading supplementary plug-ins, some of which allow for shell command execution, file system management, and TCP socket operations, they said.
The custom NeuralExecutor loader, meanwhile, implements multiple methods of network communication — namely TCP, HTTP/HTTPS, named pipes, and WebSockets. Upon establishing a communication channel with the C2 server, the backdoor can receive commands allowing it to load .NET assemblies, with its main capability being to receive additional .NET payloads from the network and execute them.
Protecting Servers from Compromise
APTs are consistently looking for ways to compromise the internal systems of targeted organizations for cyber espionage in ways that allow them to conduct persistent monitoring and exfiltration of data. High-profile China-backed actors are particularly active in this regard with a number of persistent and aggressive cyber-espionage campaigns spanning the globe at any given time.
Given that PassiveNeuron targets server machines in high-profile organizations, it&#x27;s critical that defenders pay close attention to their protection and reduce their attack surface wherever possible, as well as monitor all server applications to prevent emerging infections, the researchers said.
Due to the campaign&#x27;s targeting of SQL servers in particular, organizations also should secure applications against SQL injection flaws, which are commonly exploited by threat actors to obtain initial access, they noted. Organizations also should shore up defenses against Web shells, which attackers also often deploy to facilitate compromise of servers, the researchers added.

ColdRiver Drops Fresh Malware on Targets ColdRiver Drops Fresh Malware on Targets ColdRiver Drops Fresh Malware on Targets
The Russia-backed threat actor&#x27;s latest cyber spying campaign is a classic example of how quickly sophisticated hacking groups can pivot when exposed.
October 20, 2025
A sweeping cyber espionage campaign targeted at NATO governments, former diplomats, and high-profile NGO figures is a classic example of how quickly elite hacking groups can retool when their operations are exposed.
In May of this year, Google&#x27;s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) published details of LOSTKEYS, a sophisticated malware platform tied to Russia&#x27;s state-backed ColdRiver group. Within five days of that disclosure, ColdRiver had scrapped LOSTKEYS and rolled out an entirely new set of tools in a campaign that GTIG researcher Wesley Shields this week described as the group&#x27;s most aggressive campaign yet.
&quot;[The new malware] has undergone multiple iterations since discovery, indicating a rapidly increased development and operations tempo from ColdRiver, Shields said in a newly published report about the attacks. &quot;It is unclear how long ColdRiver had this malware in development, but GTIG has not observed a single instance of LOSTKEYS since publication.&quot;
ColdRive r, aka UNC4057, Star Blizzard , and Callisto is a Russia-linked advanced persistent threat group that has been active since at least 2017. It originally used phishing and credential theft as a vector for gaining initial access to target environments. More recently, however, the threat actor switched to deploying lightweight malware using a ClickFix CAPTCHA-style lure (&quot;verify you’re human&quot;) that tricks users into running a malicious file that then triggers the infection process. Though the group has shown an ability to constantly refine its tactics, it has also suffered repeated operational security failures that have allowed researchers to track down its infrastructure and domains and disrupt its campaigns.
Related: US Crypto Bust Offers Hope in Battle Against Cybercrime Syndicates
The group&#x27;s new toolkit centers on an initial malware downloader that GTIG has dubbed NOROBOT. GTIG found the attackers using a fake CAPTCHA lure to trick targets into running a malicious file disguised as a security check. Once installed on a system, NOROBOT communicates with a hardcoded command-and-control (C2) server, retrieves the next stage payload and prepares the system for long-term control.  In recent attacks, GTIG observed ColdRiver using a version of NOROBOT that splits its encryption key into multiple pieces, which then has to be correctly reassembled to unlock the malware. The goal: To make it harder for analysts to understand the infection process.
Initially, the attackers used NOFOBOT to download YESROBOT, a Python-based backdoor designed to give attackers full control over compromised systems. While technically functional, YESROBOT required a full Python 3.8 environment to run, making it clunky for the attackers, and relatively easy for defenders to spot.
Related: Lazarus Group Hunts European Drone Manufacturing Data
The threat actor quickly ditched that backdoor and since June has been using NOROBOT to download a PowerShell-based backdoor that GTIG researchers are tracking as MAYBEROBOT. Its purpose is to give ColdRiver actors lightweight, persistent remote control of a compromised system so they can run commands, download and execute additional payloads, and send results back to their command server.
Fast-Evolving Cyber Espionage Framework
ColdRiver&#x27;s continued tinkering with NOROBOT and the infection chain, according to GTIG, is an indication of ColdRiver&#x27;s malware development chops, and its agility. Since launching the new malware, the group has been alternatively dumbing down its infection chain to boost success rates and then reintroducing complexity to make detection harder. The result is a rapidly evolving espionage framework designed to stay one step ahead of defenders while maintaining persistent access to high-value targets, Shields said.
&quot;GTIG has observed multiple versions of NOROBOT over time with varying degrees of simplicity,&quot; the researcher wrote. &quot;The specific changes made between NOROBOT variants highlight the group&#x27;s persistent effort to evade detection systems while ensuring continued intelligence collection against high-value targets.&quot;

Detect and Block
GTIG researchers have not been able to put a finger on why exactly ColdRiver might have switched from its phishing and credential-harvesting tactics to malware deployment. One theory is that they are using the malware to harvest additional information from systems they may have already previously compromised via phishing and credential theft.
For enterprise security teams, ColdRiver&#x27;s ongoing campaign is a reminder of how quickly adversaries can adapt, retool, and resume right where they might have left off after they are publicly exposed. It also demonstrates how advanced threat actors often have backup toolkits, or can develop new ones rapidly as needed.
Google has published indicators of compromise and YARA rules for organizations to use to detect and block activity related to ColdRiver&#x27;s latest cyberattack campaign.

International Sting Takes Down SIM Box Criminal Network International Sting Takes Down SIM Box Criminal Network International Sting Takes Down SIM Box Criminal Network
The operation took down a massive SIM card fraud network that provided fake phone numbers from more than 80 countries to criminals.
October 20, 2025
Law enforcement agencies dismantled an extensive cyber-as-a-service operation that authorities say was behind a staggering 49 million online accounts used for malicious activity.
Seven individuals were arrested recently in an operation codenamed &quot;SIMCARTEL&quot; by investigators in Austria, Estonia, and Latvia, alongside Europol and Eurojust. The operation busted a criminal network that authorities tied to more than 3,200 cyber fraud cases in Austria and Latvia.
In addition to the arrests, the authorities took down five servers and seized 1,200 SIM box devices alongside 40,000 active SIM cards. The criminal network&#x27;s activities ultimately led to a total loss of several million euros, using an infrastructure that Europol described as &quot;highly sophisticated.&quot; The perpetrators used the SIM-box service to create nearly 50 million malicious online accounts for conducting telecommunications-related attacks, amongst other activities.
The criminal network created an online service that provided telephone numbers registered in more than 80 countries for threat actors to use in scams, fraud and cyberattacks, said Europol in the press release.
The SIM cards allowed threat actors to create fake accounts on telecom platforms and social media, which disguised their true identities and locations while carrying out their malicious activities.

Europol released a video of the &quot;action day&quot; in Latvia where authorities are seen breaking down glass doors to enter rooms where some of the individuals and technological devices were found. Police found what seemed like hundreds of thousands of SIM cards and other materials used in the network&#x27;s various operations.
Network Enabled Multitude of Serious Crimes
Additionally, authorities took control of two websites offering illegal services, while suspects&#x27; accounts containing €431,000 and $333,000 were frozen.
Europol said it dismantled the network&#x27;s infrastructure with the help of the Shadowserver Foundation, a cybersecurity nonprofit. Dark Reading contacted Shadowserver for comment, but the organization said it doesn&#x27;t comment on law enforcement activity as a policy. In a post on social media platform X , Shadowserver said it was proud to &quot;support our Law Enforcement partners in another successful cybercrime disruption.&quot;
The scale of the network, which Europol said is still being uncovered, allowed criminals to commit &quot;a multitude of serious crimes that would not have been possible at all without masking the perpetrators&#x27; identities.&quot;
Some of these crimes and malicious activities include phishing , smishing, fraud, extortion , migrant smuggling, the impersonation of police officers, the distribution of child sexual abuse materials, and more.

The dismantling of this criminal network was part of the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT), which runs in four-year cycles focusing on EU crime priorities.
In its current cycle, its priorities are identifying and disrupting high-risk criminal networks, targeting criminal offenders orchestrating cyberattacks, disrupting criminal networks engaged in human trafficking, combatting child exploitation, fighting against migrant smuggling, fraud and financial crimes, and more.

Is Your Car a BYOD Risk? Researchers Demonstrate How Is Your Car a BYOD Risk? Researchers Demonstrate How Is Your Car a BYOD Risk? Researchers Demonstrate How
If an employee&#x27;s phone connects to their car and then their corporate network, an attack against the car can reach the company.
October 20, 2025
Bring your own device (BYOD) threats continue to expand, as researchers have demonstrated that even the car you drive to work can constitute an initial access vector into a corporate network.
At BSides NYC on Oct. 18, Threatlight chief technology officer (CTO) and co-founder Tim Shipp detailed a proof-of-concept (PoC) attack chain that began in a parked car and ended in corporate Linux servers and ESXi hypervisors . Call it a BYOC — a  bring-your-own-car attack. And it required only a few cheap gadgets.
The key (pun intended) was the driver&#x27;s phone — using the car to reach the phone, then using the phone to reach the company&#x27;s network.
&quot;I think it&#x27;s important to remind organizations that are all looking for futuristic attacks and next-generation solutions: an attacker will go for what&#x27;s easy and readily available,&quot; says Lisa Landau, Threatlight&#x27;s CEO and other co-founder. &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t forget that what&#x27;s easy and cheap is definitely [viable].&quot;
Jamming a Car to Hack a Phone
Recently, Shipp was doing red team work for a late-stage startup company with an advanced cybersecurity posture: good endpoint detection and response (EDR), a diligent security operations center (SOC), the works. Even when he did manage to access any privileged systems, he was rooted out just as quickly. Eventually, he recalls, &quot;I was just trying to get in through a different avenue — something that wasn&#x27;t as monitored, wasn&#x27;t as obvious.&quot;
Related: Microsoft Issues Emergency Patch for Critical Windows Server Bug
He found his different avenue in the parking lot, in the form of a fleet of company-issued Teslas for privileged employees. The Teslas had no relationship to the company&#x27;s network, but the drivers&#x27; phones that were connected to the vehicles did.
The idea, then, was to somehow use a car to get to a phone, then from a phone into the corporate network. That meant planting himself in between a target car and the driver connecting their phone to it.
If not by physical cable, a phone and a car will hook up over Bluetooth . Typically, it happens shortly after the driver gets in the vehicle: they activate the engine, pair their phone with the head unit, and queue up Spotify before driving off. That presents a brief window for a penetration tester to work with.
Shipp&#x27;s idea was a kind of reverse of the usual vehicle hack : instead of impersonating a driver&#x27;s phone to connect to their head unit, he&#x27;d impersonate their car&#x27;s Bluetooth signal to get to their phone.
To illustrate how easy that was, he used cheap handheld gadgets. First, he started with some business card-sized microcontrollers called &quot;cardputers&quot; ($30 each). With some NRF24 transceiver modules hooked in ($15 each), he was able to jam the Tesla&#x27;s Bluetooth signal.
Related: Fear the &#x27;SessionReaper&#x27;: Adobe Commerce Flaw Under Attack
Disconnected from their vehicle, the driver opened the Bluetooth settings on their Android phone and attempted to connect manually. Shipp advertised his own signal from a FlipperZero ($200) hacking multitool, spoofing a generic Tesla Bluetooth device name, inviting the driver to connect without a second thought.
From Car to Car-porate Servers
Shipp used his FlipperZero&#x27;s &quot;BadUSB&quot; mode to mimic a USB keyboard, sending the phone a prearranged series of malicious commands that allowed him to transmit his own Android Package (APK) file. The APK established an initial Metasploit shell connecting back to his command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.
The shell was unstable. In Android 15, developers introduced &quot;foreground service timeouts,&quot; with particularly strict three-minute limits on &quot;short&quot; services like uploads, downloads, and syncs. From a security standpoint, the idea is that if a service is downloading something or exfiltrating data for an extended period of time, it may well be malicious in nature.
When Shipp&#x27;s shell activated, the device assigned it a countdown clock. But having programmed his exploit in advance, the process of rooting it only took a matter of seconds. Then he turned on the Android Debug Bridge over the air, configured it to allow for remote connections, and used the open source terminal emulator app &quot;Termux&quot; to solidify his foothold.

This sort of access, on its own, could have caused any amount of harm to a company. A high-level employee&#x27;s puppeted phone could be used to exfiltrate sensitive corporate data. An attacker could blackmail the employee, or glean details about them for follow-on spear-phishing attacks. They could even use the victim&#x27;s phone to send those emails or text messages to colleagues.
In this case, though, Shipp was looking for the shortest path to the kinds of corporate systems attackers like most. All he had to do was wait for the employee to walk into work, and when their phone connected to the company network, he performed the lateral movement necessary to reach domain controllers and ESXi hypervisors.
Should You Bring Your Own Solution for BYOC?
There are a number of cyber protections that could have slowed or stopped Shipp&#x27;s attack chain in its tracks: Any competent security programs running on the phone, checking for unusual device behavior. A company-wide mobile device management (MDM) strategy. Some diligent network segmentation.
Regardless of how any particular company chooses to implement a mobile cybersecurity plan, Shipp says, the point is to remind everyone that &quot;in most of the attacks we see, it&#x27;s not big, clever tricks that cause a breach. It&#x27;s never the greatest CVE or zero-day exploit. It&#x27;s old, obscure, or unsecured platforms that people have forgotten about. It&#x27;s just a gap that we all missed.&quot;
Landau emphasizes that the gap between systems, more so than any particular weakness in any given system, is what gave Shipp his path in. She says that &quot;people tend to look at their stack and say: &#x27;OK, I have an EDR for this, and I have a solution for that.&#x27; But then [those systems] are not speaking to each other. And at the end of the day, they will be compromised because the glue is missing between the two.&quot;
&quot;We can say, &#x27;Apply these policies to your mobile devices,&#x27;&quot; she says. &quot;But [it&#x27;s more about] looking at security in a more holistic way, rather than a solution per problem, which causes you to miss the problems that are falling between the cracks.&quot;

Recently, Shipp was doing red team work for a late-stage startup company with an advanced cybersecurity posture: good endpoint detection and response (EDR), a diligent security operations center (SOC), the works. Even when he did manage to access any privileged systems, he was rooted out just as quickly. Eventually, he recalls, &quot;I was just trying to get in through a different avenue — something that wasn&#x27;t as monitored, wasn&#x27;t as obvious.&quot;

He found his different avenue in the parking lot, in the form of a fleet of company-issued Teslas for privileged employees. The Teslas had no relationship to the company&#x27;s network, but the drivers&#x27; phones that were connected to the vehicles did.
The idea, then, was to somehow use a car to get to a phone, then from a phone into the corporate network. That meant planting himself in between a target car and the driver connecting their phone to it.
If not by physical cable, a phone and a car will hook up over Bluetooth . Typically, it happens shortly after the driver gets in the vehicle: they activate the engine, pair their phone with the head unit, and queue up Spotify before driving off. That presents a brief window for a penetration tester to work with.
Shipp&#x27;s idea was a kind of reverse of the usual vehicle hack : instead of impersonating a driver&#x27;s phone to connect to their head unit, he&#x27;d impersonate their car&#x27;s Bluetooth signal to get to their phone.
To illustrate how easy that was, he used cheap handheld gadgets. First, he started with some business card-sized microcontrollers called &quot;cardputers&quot; ($30 each). With some NRF24 transceiver modules hooked in ($15 each), he was able to jam the Tesla&#x27;s Bluetooth signal.

Disconnected from their vehicle, the driver opened the Bluetooth settings on their Android phone and attempted to connect manually. Shipp advertised his own signal from a FlipperZero ($200) hacking multitool, spoofing a generic Tesla Bluetooth device name, inviting the driver to connect without a second thought.
From Car to Car-porate Servers
Shipp used his FlipperZero&#x27;s &quot;BadUSB&quot; mode to mimic a USB keyboard, sending the phone a prearranged series of malicious commands that allowed him to transmit his own Android Package (APK) file. The APK established an initial Metasploit shell connecting back to his command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.
The shell was unstable. In Android 15, developers introduced &quot;foreground service timeouts,&quot; with particularly strict three-minute limits on &quot;short&quot; services like uploads, downloads, and syncs. From a security standpoint, the idea is that if a service is downloading something or exfiltrating data for an extended period of time, it may well be malicious in nature.
When Shipp&#x27;s shell activated, the device assigned it a countdown clock. But having programmed his exploit in advance, the process of rooting it only took a matter of seconds. Then he turned on the Android Debug Bridge over the air, configured it to allow for remote connections, and used the open source terminal emulator app &quot;Termux&quot; to solidify his foothold.

This sort of access, on its own, could have caused any amount of harm to a company. A high-level employee&#x27;s puppeted phone could be used to exfiltrate sensitive corporate data. An attacker could blackmail the employee, or glean details about them for follow-on spear-phishing attacks. They could even use the victim&#x27;s phone to send those emails or text messages to colleagues.
In this case, though, Shipp was looking for the shortest path to the kinds of corporate systems attackers like most. All he had to do was wait for the employee to walk into work, and when their phone connected to the company network, he performed the lateral movement necessary to reach domain controllers and ESXi hypervisors.
Should You Bring Your Own Solution for BYOC?
There are a number of cyber protections that could have slowed or stopped Shipp&#x27;s attack chain in its tracks: Any competent security programs running on the phone, checking for unusual device behavior. A company-wide mobile device management (MDM) strategy. Some diligent network segmentation.
Regardless of how any particular company chooses to implement a mobile cybersecurity plan, Shipp says, the point is to remind everyone that &quot;in most of the attacks we see, it&#x27;s not big, clever tricks that cause a breach. It&#x27;s never the greatest CVE or zero-day exploit. It&#x27;s old, obscure, or unsecured platforms that people have forgotten about. It&#x27;s just a gap that we all missed.&quot;
Landau emphasizes that the gap between systems, more so than any particular weakness in any given system, is what gave Shipp his path in. She says that &quot;people tend to look at their stack and say: &#x27;OK, I have an EDR for this, and I have a solution for that.&#x27; But then [those systems] are not speaking to each other. And at the end of the day, they will be compromised because the glue is missing between the two.&quot;
&quot;We can say, &#x27;Apply these policies to your mobile devices,&#x27;&quot; she says. &quot;But [it&#x27;s more about] looking at security in a more holistic way, rather than a solution per problem, which causes you to miss the problems that are falling between the cracks.&quot;

Flawed Vendor Guidance Exposes Enterprises to Avoidable Risk Flawed Vendor Guidance Exposes Enterprises to Avoidable Risk Flawed Vendor Guidance Exposes Enterprises to Avoidable Risk
Oracle E-Business Suite customers received conflicting deployment guidance, leaving enterprises exposed a recent zero-day flaw, Andrew argues.
October 20, 2025
COMMENTARY
The fallout from Oracle&#x27;s latest zero-day (CVE-2025-61882) continues to spread, with Harvard University recently disclosing it suffered a data leak stemming from an attack targeting the flaw. The vulnerability carries an &quot;easily exploitable&quot; CVSS score of 9.8 and enables unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE).
Targeting a fully integrated business application, such as Oracle&#x27;s E-Business Suite, is debilitating because it grants attackers access to critical data and functionality. While this vulnerability is significant, Oracle&#x27;s E-Business Suite should never have been exposed to the Internet, due to the nature of the service and the sensitivity of the data housed within it. The episode raises questions about deployment documents and the role it plays in exposing enterprise systems to avoidable risk.
After investigating the attack further, it appears as if the failure was at least partially preventable.
An unauthenticated attacker sent a request to an exposed Oracle E-Business Suite instance that caused the application to execute attacker-controlled code from the Internet. Once successful, they gained interactive access to the system using a reverse shell. Interactive access gives them greater control, allowing the attackers to run commands and upload files without constraints. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers with network access to compromise Oracle Concurrent Processing. This security chain turned a core business application into a sitting duck.

Documentation Contradictions: WAFs versus Bastions
The greatest concern from this vulnerability, besides the immediate disaster of dealing with a breach, is the cybersecurity industry&#x27;s messaging and guidelines on attack surface management.
Standard principles argue that integrated business applications, like Oracle&#x27;s E-Business Suite, should be safely located behind a bastion, meaning protection from an edge device or virtual private network instead of the Internet. It&#x27;s unclear why these applications were left unguarded, but further research points to a potential hypothesis.
In past deployment documents, Oracle falsely claimed that Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are &quot;designed to offer these types of protections&quot; against application attacks targeting the E-Business Suite when it is &quot;exposed to the Internet.&quot; Additionally, Oracle claimed its guidelines included rules to protect against common injection flaws, the exact class of weakness that forms the initial vector for this type of unauthenticated attack. While WAFs are OK for reducing exploit likelihood, attackers can and often do find workarounds to exploit vulnerabilities like this.
Related: Fear the &#x27;SessionReaper&#x27;: Adobe Commerce Flaw Under Attack
This literature contradicts the official deployment documentation , which &quot;recommends creating separate subnets for your instances&quot; to ensure that &quot;appropriate security requirements can be implemented across the different subnets.&quot; The documentation acknowledges that Oracle E-Business Suite should not be exposed to the Internet, and if it indeed requires Internet exposure, a bastion host should be used to access the instance. Security teams that followed the first set of recommendations and focused on the WAF, rather than the more complex network segmentations, may have unintentionally left their EBS systems at risk.
Disappointingly, other cybersecurity authorities, such as the UK&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centre, incorrectly link to the misleading article over the deployment documentation.
Oracle&#x27;s conflicting guidance is compounded by the fact that the zero-day vulnerability was reportedly under active exploitation for more than eight weeks . Threat actors quietly stole sensitive data before victims were alerted.
Proper documentation is essential to prevent these compromises and technology vendors must ensure customers receive the correct guidance for vulnerabilities. Failing to provide up-to-date protections and instructions leaves organizations exposed. Oracle must take efforts to thoroughly assess their guidance and ensure they are providing their customers with the best defense against these sorts of attacks. Other vendors should conduct a review of their documentation to ensure they won&#x27;t leave their own customers in a similar lurch should their infrastructure be compromised. Finally, organizations should always do their due diligence and review their own infrastructures for potential exposures as opposed solely relying on vendors for defense.

Bombarding Cars With Lasers: Novel Auto Cyberattacks Emerge Bombarding Cars With Lasers: Novel Auto Cyberattacks Emerge Bombarding Cars With Lasers: Novel Auto Cyberattacks Emerge
Hardware attacks using lasers against silicon chips are difficult but possible. A fresh microchip protection approach aims to make it harder.
October 20, 2025
Researchers are proposing that microchip manufacturers adopt a new multi-layered, insulating design to protect them against cyber-physical attacks, primarily from lasers.
On Monday, members of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and Soitec, a semiconductor manufacturing company, released a report advocating for a new kind of microchip technology designed to strengthen automotive cybersecurity. It&#x27;s called &quot; Fully Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator &quot; (FD-SOI), and it obstructs cyber-physical attacks against chips, making already elaborate and costly attack scenarios even more unrealistic than they might already seem.
&quot;Safety and trust depend on hardware that resists rare but consequential tampering,&quot; says Philippe Flatresse, director of business development at Soitec. Though in the end, FD-SOI may be more likely to spread for being cost-effective and easing compliance with global vehicle security regulations.
FD-SOI Anti Car-Hacking Chip, Explained
Instead of stamping billions of transistors directly on a silicon wafer and calling it a day — as is the case in standard chips — FD-SOI involves a multi-layered substrate with an insulating buried oxide (BOX) layer. This layer serves to isolate transistors from one another, and the base underneath.
Related: The Fight Against Ransomware Heats Up on the Factory Floor
The point is to make an exotic method of cyber-physical attack known as fault injection — and, specifically, &quot;laser fault injection&quot; (LFI) — far more difficult.
In LFI, an attacker uses a focused laser pulse to introduce a temporary error in the transistors that make up a logic circuit. Instead of frying the chip, a specially crafted and controlled laser pulse can cause a bit to flip or an instruction to skip, among other errors. With that, an attacker can induce a cyber vulnerability — such as a skipped authentication check, a leaked key, etc.
CEA and Soitec found that, thanks to the way FD-SOI&#x27;s BOX buffer limits energy spread, attackers required more laser power to perform LFI attacks. More than that, though, they needed much more time. The same attack might require 10 minutes on a standard chip, and 10 hours against FD-SOI. And that&#x27;s to say nothing of the risk therein of damaging the chip beyond utility.
Laser Fault Injection Attack Scenarios
Modern consumer vehicles contain anywhere from a couple dozen to more than 100 microcontroller units (MCUs), which oversee everything from the brightness of lights to critical vehicle control systems. Cars with self-driving or other cutting-edge features will even utilize AI-capable MCUs.
Related: Cyberattack Leads to Beer Shortage as Asahi Recovers
If ever researchers are so bold as to attack these critical MCUs — and thereby manipulate the vehicle — they typically attempt it through an information channel; the in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system is a popular option, or even wireless keys. Any system that connects to an MCU can theoretically get you there.
Fault injection attacks skip all that and instead use physical means to directly affect the physical chip. It therefore requires physical access not just to a vehicle, but the innards that the body hides from view. Therefore, Flatresse explains, &quot;realistic scenarios are those where an adversary briefly controls the electronic control unit (ECU) or telematics unit: a vehicle in a service bay, a stolen or salvaged ECU brought to a bench, or supply-chain tampering.&quot;
In practice, he notes, &quot;attackers often use LFI in the lab to map vulnerabilities at sub-micron or nanosecond granularity, then replicate the same fault conditions in the field.&quot; Coordinating transistor states with laser pulses in the first place, and then identifying the particular location and time one needs to aim for to affect a specific cyber consequence, is a serious trial-and-error process.
In theory LFI is possible for elite, specialized threat actors backed with nation-state-level resources. Conceivable attack scenarios widen a bit, too, when one considers that LFI can affect silicon chips in any device, be it a drone, life-saving medical device, or manufacturing equipment.
Related: Undocumented Radios Found in Solar-Powered Devices
How FD-SOI Enables Compliance and Cost Savings
It might sound like a James Bond plot, but Flatresse emphasizes that regulators are taking the LFI threat seriously. &quot;[They] treat LFI as a worst-case enabling technique. It systematically exposes weaknesses others can later trigger more crudely.&quot;
Since January 2021, for example, the United Nations (UN) Regulation No. 155 (R155) has required that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) implement cybersecurity management systems (CMS) to protect vehicles from cyber risks throughout their entire development lifecycle. The mandate applies to 54 countries, including the entire European Union, UK, Japan, and South Korea. And it encompasses any kind of motor vehicle on wheels: passenger cars, trucks, buses, even trailers if they have electronic controls.
Among the threats listed in UN R155 is physical manipulation of electronic hardware. Though the document doesn&#x27;t reference them by name, fault injection attacks represent the extreme end of that category, with LFI as the extreme end of fault injection attacks.
ISO/SAE 21434, a global industry framework often used to demonstrate compliance with UN R155, makes a more direct reference; Flatresse says that it explicitly considers fault injection as part of a risk analysis.
While few would fault Toyota for failing to defend soccer moms from exotic laser beam attacks, Flatresse argues that FD-SOI chips are worth considering even on the basis of cost effectiveness. Though they require the extra layer, the insulating effect of that layer reduces electrical noise, leakage, overheating, and more considerations that engineers might otherwise have to compensate for. And they&#x27;re flat, unlike the Fin Field-Effect Transistor (FinFET) tech used in some systems-on-chips (SoCs). Taken together, &quot;this simplicity translates into a more predictable yield and lower overall die cost,&quot; Flatresse says.
He maintains, however, that preventing LFI is the main goal. &quot;FD-SOI is not &#x27;unhackable,&#x27; but by breaking the substrate paths that faults exploit, it raises the bar — exactly what regulators and safety programs need today.&quot;

Self-Propagating GlassWorm Attacks VS Code Supply Chain Self-Propagating GlassWorm Attacks VS Code Supply Chain Self-Propagating GlassWorm Attacks VS Code Supply Chain
The sophisticated worm — which uses invisible code to steal credentials and turn developer systems into criminal proxies — has so far infected nearly 36k machines.
October 20, 2025
A self-propagating worm is targeting Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions in a complex supply chain attack that has infected 35,800 developer machines so far with techniques the likes of which researchers said they haven&#x27;t seen before in the wild.
Researchers at Koi Security discovered the malware, dubbed &quot;GlassWorm,&quot; on Oct. 18, after flagging an extension on the OpenVSX marketplace — an open source alternative to the Visual Studio Marketplace — called CodeJoy that &quot;introduced some suspicious behavioral changes,&quot; according to a blog post by Koi CTO and co-founder Idan Dardikman published on Saturday.
An investigation revealed that the extension was infected with an unusually stealthy malware that used printable Unicode characters that don&#x27;t render in a code editor, basically making &quot;malicious code literally disappear,&quot; Dardikman wrote.
&quot;The malware is invisible,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Not obfuscated. Not hidden in a minified file. Actually invisible to the human eye.&quot;
Further analysis uncovered a self-propagating malware that uses the Solana blockchain as its C2 and Google Calendar as a backup command server; harvests credentials from NPM, GitHub, and Git credentials for supply chain propagation; targets cryptocurrency wallets; deploys SOCKS proxy servers to turn developer machines into extended C2 infrastructure; installs hidden virtual network computing (VNC) servers for complete remote access; and spreads further by using stolen credentials to compromise additional packages and extensions.

GlassWorm initially infected several extensions on Oct. 17, three of which are still actively distributing malware , while four of which have since been updated to a clean version, Dardikman tells Dark Reading on Monday. However, their malicious versions are still online and available for download, he says.
Meanwhile, GlassWorm also has spread beyond Open VSX to an extension on Microsoft&#x27;s official VS Code marketplace ; once Koi reported the extension, however, Microsoft immediately removed it, Dardikman tells Dark Reading.
Invisible Code &#x27;Like Glass&#x27;
Dardikman compared GlassWorm to another malware campaign that affected the NPM package supply chain that Koi also discovered: Shai Hulud . However, GlassWorm is potentially more dangerous in that its invisible code obfuscation technique — which inspired its name — &quot;completely breaks traditional code review, &quot; Dardkiman wrote in the post.
&quot;Like glass, it&#x27;s completely transparent,&quot; he wrote. &quot;You can stare right at it and see nothing. The developer whose account got compromised probably looked at this file, saw what appeared to be their legitimate code, and had no idea they were about to distribute malware to hundreds of users.&quot;

This is a major paradigm shift for security researchers, who have built entire systems around the assumption that humans can review code to ensure its security and legitimacy, Dardikman wrote. &quot;GlassWorm just proved that assumption wrong,&quot; he wrote, telling Dark Reading on Monday that &quot;this is honestly the most sophisticated attack we&#x27;ve yet to investigate.&quot;
Beyond its built-in invisibility cloak, GlassWorm also has an extensive ability to wreak havoc on an infected system through its various aforementioned features once it spreads via infected extensions.
Among these, two aspects of the malware are particularly dangerous. One is its use of stolen NPM, GitHub, OpenVSX, and Git credentials to compromise more packages and extensions. &quot;Each new victim becomes an infection vector,&quot; giving the malware its classification as a worm and not a one-off infection, Dardikman wrote.
The other is its final stage, a module called &quot;ZOMBI&quot; that &quot;transforms every infected developer workstation into a node in a criminal infrastructure network,&quot; he wrote. This gives attackers free proxy networks with far-reaching malware distribution throughout the software supply chain.

Mitigation of GlassWorm
Threat actors have discovered in recent years that by poisoning code registries with malicious tools and extensions for software, they can quickly spread malware through supply chains. While NPM registries have been frequent targets, the emergence of GlassWorm demonstrates that no code repositories or software marketplaces are safe, and attackers are growing ever sophisticated in their methods of spreading malware and covering their tracks.
To help organizations identify software that&#x27;s been poisoned with GlassWorm, Koi included various indicators of compromise (IoCs), including the names of poisoned extensions, C2 and payload URLs, and persistence mechanisms.
Any organizations that identify IoCs in their infrastructure should assume they have been compromised and that their credentials were likely stolen, cryptocurrency wallets may have been drained, and that machines are already serving as a SOCKS proxy for criminal activity, according to Dardikman.
In these cases, Dardikman says organizations should take the following steps for infected machines: Rotate all secrets, including NPM tokens, Github tokens, and OpenVSX and VSCode tokens, as well as all passwords. They also should format the machine to ensure full removal of the malware.

Self-Propagating GlassWorm Attacks VS Code Supply Chain Self-Propagating GlassWorm Attacks VS Code Supply Chain Self-Propagating GlassWorm Attacks VS Code Supply Chain
The sophisticated worm — which uses invisible code to steal credentials and turn developer systems into criminal proxies — has so far infected nearly 36k machines.
October 20, 2025
A self-propagating worm is targeting Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions in a complex supply chain attack that has infected 35,800 developer machines so far with techniques the likes of which researchers said they haven&#x27;t seen before in the wild.
Researchers at Koi Security discovered the malware, dubbed &quot;GlassWorm,&quot; on Oct. 18, after flagging an extension on the OpenVSX marketplace — an open source alternative to the Visual Studio Marketplace — called CodeJoy that &quot;introduced some suspicious behavioral changes,&quot; according to a blog post by Koi CTO and co-founder Idan Dardikman published on Saturday.
An investigation revealed that the extension was infected with an unusually stealthy malware that used printable Unicode characters that don&#x27;t render in a code editor, basically making &quot;malicious code literally disappear,&quot; Dardikman wrote.
&quot;The malware is invisible,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Not obfuscated. Not hidden in a minified file. Actually invisible to the human eye.&quot;
Further analysis uncovered a self-propagating malware that uses the Solana blockchain as its C2 and Google Calendar as a backup command server; harvests credentials from NPM, GitHub, and Git credentials for supply chain propagation; targets cryptocurrency wallets; deploys SOCKS proxy servers to turn developer machines into extended C2 infrastructure; installs hidden virtual network computing (VNC) servers for complete remote access; and spreads further by using stolen credentials to compromise additional packages and extensions.

GlassWorm initially infected several extensions on Oct. 17, three of which are still actively distributing malware , while four of which have since been updated to a clean version, Dardikman tells Dark Reading on Monday. However, their malicious versions are still online and available for download, he says.
Meanwhile, GlassWorm also has spread beyond Open VSX to an extension on Microsoft&#x27;s official VS Code marketplace ; once Koi reported the extension, however, Microsoft immediately removed it, Dardikman tells Dark Reading.
Invisible Code &#x27;Like Glass&#x27;
Dardikman compared GlassWorm to another malware campaign that affected the NPM package supply chain that Koi also discovered: Shai Hulud . However, GlassWorm is potentially more dangerous in that its invisible code obfuscation technique — which inspired its name — &quot;completely breaks traditional code review, &quot; Dardkiman wrote in the post.
&quot;Like glass, it&#x27;s completely transparent,&quot; he wrote. &quot;You can stare right at it and see nothing. The developer whose account got compromised probably looked at this file, saw what appeared to be their legitimate code, and had no idea they were about to distribute malware to hundreds of users.&quot;

This is a major paradigm shift for security researchers, who have built entire systems around the assumption that humans can review code to ensure its security and legitimacy, Dardikman wrote. &quot;GlassWorm just proved that assumption wrong,&quot; he wrote, telling Dark Reading on Monday that &quot;this is honestly the most sophisticated attack we&#x27;ve yet to investigate.&quot;
Beyond its built-in invisibility cloak, GlassWorm also has an extensive ability to wreak havoc on an infected system through its various aforementioned features once it spreads via infected extensions.
Among these, two aspects of the malware are particularly dangerous. One is its use of stolen NPM, GitHub, OpenVSX, and Git credentials to compromise more packages and extensions. &quot;Each new victim becomes an infection vector,&quot; giving the malware its classification as a worm and not a one-off infection, Dardikman wrote.
The other is its final stage, a module called &quot;ZOMBI&quot; that &quot;transforms every infected developer workstation into a node in a criminal infrastructure network,&quot; he wrote. This gives attackers free proxy networks with far-reaching malware distribution throughout the software supply chain.

Mitigation of GlassWorm
Threat actors have discovered in recent years that by poisoning code registries with malicious tools and extensions for software, they can quickly spread malware through supply chains. While NPM registries have been frequent targets, the emergence of GlassWorm demonstrates that no code repositories or software marketplaces are safe, and attackers are growing ever sophisticated in their methods of spreading malware and covering their tracks.
To help organizations identify software that&#x27;s been poisoned with GlassWorm, Koi included various indicators of compromise (IoCs), including the names of poisoned extensions, C2 and payload URLs, and persistence mechanisms.
Any organizations that identify IoCs in their infrastructure should assume they have been compromised and that their credentials were likely stolen, cryptocurrency wallets may have been drained, and that machines are already serving as a SOCKS proxy for criminal activity, according to Dardikman.
In these cases, Dardikman says organizations should take the following steps for infected machines: Rotate all secrets, including NPM tokens, Github tokens, and OpenVSX and VSCode tokens, as well as all passwords. They also should format the machine to ensure full removal of the malware.

Cyber Academy Founder Champions Digital Safety for All Cyber Academy Founder Champions Digital Safety for All Cyber Academy Founder Champions Digital Safety for All
Aliyu Ibrahim Usman, founder of the Cyber Cadet Academy in Nigeria, shares his passion for raising cybersecurity awareness in the wake of mounting security concerns worldwide.
October 18, 2025
Aliyu Ibrahim Usman honed his hacking skills at age 14. However, he hid those talents from family and friends due to the negative connotation that surrounded hacking in Nigeria, even though he was being ethical and not using it for criminal purposes. When he was 19, he founded the Cyber Cadet Academy, a training and research center for university students and professionals interested in pursuing cybersecurity careers.
Now 23, Usman&#x27;s hopes of raising cybersecurity awareness and education are coming true, not only with the academy but he also founded and organized this month&#x27;s inaugural BSides cybersecurity conference in Kano, Nigeria.
&quot;There are so many people who don&#x27;t have basic cybersecurity knowledge and how it can impact their lives,&quot; Usman tells Dark Reading. &quot;We need awareness and training in that regard and in how to build a career in cybersecurity.&quot;
Who Will Participate in BSides?
Usman had one goal in mind while organizing the BSides conference: to bring stakeholders together. To that end, university and secondary school students will hear from the Nigeria Police Force, the National Information Technology Development Agency, and the Economic and Financial Crime Commission, which works to fight fraud.
Usman says he is highly concerned about online child safety , so it was particularly important to raise awareness for that audience.

&quot;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of kids fallen into so many crazy activities online because they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s best for them, and older people take advantage of children,&quot; he says. &quot;I want them to hear what can be done and how they can be safe.&quot;
All Roads Lead to Security
Like many in the cybersecurity industry, Usman&#x27;s career decision was propelled by curiosity.
He learned about WordPress, saw it had a log in form, and thought, &#x27;What if someone had the password?&#x27; If someone was scammed, he&#x27;d investigate the crime for free and forward the information to the authorities. These types of questions eventually led him into security.
&quot;People need basic knowledge, even if it&#x27;s not a career,&quot; he says. &quot;I investigated cases where someone will just call and ask for their OTP [one-time password], and that&#x27;s basic. People need to know what that means.&quot;
He also recognized that because everything is interconnected, cybersecurity was a global problem. Learning and developing new ways to secure critical infrastructure is now a focal point for Usman and his students. He officially registered the Cyber Cadet Academy last year as a legitimate company, though it operated for three years prior. It&#x27;s a solo operation where he teaches and oversees a maximum of 20 students.

&quot;We need to create a new strategy to protect ourselves, so that&#x27;s why I came up with the cyber academy,&quot; he explains. &quot;The vision is to become the leading institute when it comes to training and research in Africa.&quot;

The Student Becomes the Teacher
The first question Usman asks newly enrolled academy students is: &quot;What do you want to achieve at the end of this program?&quot; His end goal is for students to master those goals. His expectations are often exceeded.
&quot;The happiest moment is when I ask at the end, and they said they got to learn more than what they expected,&quot; he says. &quot;And more than what they were taught at university.&quot;
Those responses instill confidence in Usman. He plans to expand the center, bring in more people, and perhaps train students to become the staff.

Microsoft Disrupts Ransomware Campaign Abusing Azure Certificates Microsoft Disrupts Ransomware Campaign Abusing Azure Certificates Microsoft Disrupts Ransomware Campaign Abusing Azure Certificates
Microsoft revoked more than 200 digital certificates that threat actors used to sign fake Teams binaries that set the stage for Rhysida ransomware attacks.
October 17, 2025
Microsoft disrupted a Rhysida ransomware campaign that used fake Teams binaries signed with digital certificates, including many from Microsoft&#x27;s own service.
In a social media post on X, Microsoft Threat Intelligence on Wednesday said it revoked more than 200 code-signing certificates issued by Azure&#x27;s Trusted Signing service. These certificates are sometimes abused by threat actors to make malware appear as if it is legitimate, trusted software.
According to the post, a cybercriminal group tracked by Microsoft as Vanilla Tempest crafted the fake Teams files to drop a backdoor known as &quot;Oyster,&quot; which allowed attackers to eventually deliver Rhysida ransomware in victims&#x27; networks.
Vanilla Tempest, also known as Vice Society, has a track record of targeting healthcare organizations and public schools, though it&#x27;s unclear what organizations the group was targeting with its latest campaign.
&quot;In this campaign, Vanilla Tempest used fake MSTeamsSetup.exe files hosted on malicious domains mimicking Microsoft Teams, for example, teams-download[.]buzz, teams-install[.]run, or teams-download[.]top,&quot; Microsoft Threat Intelligence wrote in the X post . &quot;Users are likely directed to malicious download sites using search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning.&quot;

Attackers Signing Malware with Digital Certificates
When clicked, the fake Teams files ran a malware downloader instead of the widely used unified communications application. The downloader then installed the digitally signed Oyster backdoor, which Vanilla Tempest has used in attacks as far back as June, according to Microsoft.
Microsoft said Vanilla Tempest has deployed other ransomware strains in the past, including BlackCat , but has shifted primarily to Rhysida recently. In addition to using Azure&#x27;s Trusted Signing service, the attackers also acquired code-signing certificates from SSL.com, DigiCert, and GlobalSign to authenticate their fake installers and malicious tools, Microsoft said in the post.
Signing malicious files with valid code-signing certificates gives threat actors a decided advantage against enterprise security teams. Such certificates are used to ensure trust in the application, and most detection systems will either flag or block binaries that lack a valid signature. Thus, the certificates in question made the fake Teams binaries look like the real thing.
It&#x27;s unclear how Vanilla Tempest acquired the certificates from Trusted Signing, which Microsoft describes as a fully managed, end-to-end  service for partner developers to deploy applications. According to a quickstart guide for Trusted Signing, users must have a Microsoft Entra tenant ID and an Azure subscription.

The service is currently available in US and European Azure regions, though the guide, which was last updated on Oct. 7, includes a note that states &quot;At this time Trusted Signing is available to organizations and DBAs based in the USA and Canada that have a verifiable history of three years or more.&quot;
Dark Reading contacted Microsoft for comment but a company spokesperson said the company had nothing further to add.
It appears Microsoft did not report the malicious activity to the other certificate authorities cited in its post. A DigiCert spokesperson provided the following statement to Dark Reading:
&quot;DigiCert is aware of Microsoft’s report on the Rhysida ransomware campaign. At this time, we have not been asked to revoke any DigiCert-issued certificates related to this report. We take any potential certificate misuse seriously and will act immediately to investigate and, if warranted, revoke certificates upon receipt of credible intelligence or a formal request from appropriate parties.&quot;
GlobalSign provided a similar statement to Dark Reading from CISO Arvid Vermote. &quot;GlobalSign ensures that all the certificates it issues are issued to rightful and verified (third) parties,&quot; &quot;If GlobalSign receives notice or detects a compromise/misuse of a certificate it is investigated by a 24/7 team of experts,&quot; Vermote said. &quot;In the case of abuse, key compromise or if malware signing is confirmed, the certificates are promptly revoked in line with industry regulations and requirements.&quot;

AI Agent Security: Whose Responsibility Is It? AI Agent Security: Whose Responsibility Is It? AI Agent Security: Whose Responsibility Is It?
The shared responsibility model of data security, familiar from cloud deployments, is key to agentic services, but cybersecurity teams and corporate users often struggle with awareness and managing that risk.
October 17, 2025
Agentic AI deployments are becoming an imperative for organizations of all sizes looking to boost productivity and streamline processes, especially as major platforms like Microsoft and Salesforce build agents into their offerings. In the rush to deploy and use these helpers, it&#x27;s important that businesses understand that there&#x27;s a shared security responsibility between vendor and customer that will be critical to the success of any agentic AI project.
The stakes in ignoring security are potentially high: last month for instance, AI security vendor Noma detailed how it discovered &quot;ForcedLeak,&quot; a critical severity vulnerability chain in Salesforce&#x27;s agentic AI offering Agentforce, which could have allowed a threat actor to exfiltrate sensitive CRM data from a customer with improper security controls through an indirect prompt injection attack. Although Salesforce addressed the issue through updates and access control recommendations, ForcedLeak is but one example of the potential for agents to leak sensitive data, either through improper access controls, ingested secrets, or a prompt injection attack.
It&#x27;s not an easy task to add agentic AI security to the mix; it&#x27;s already challenging enough to determine where responsibility and culpability lie with traditional software and cloud deployments. With something like AI, where the technology can be hastily rolled out (by both vendor and customer alike) and is constantly evolving, establishing those barriers can prove even more complex.
Related: How CISA Layoffs Weaken Civilian Cyber Defense
Moreover, organizations are addressing other security awareness challenges like phishing, and have had to contend with determining the best way to offload as much risk as possible from the user, rather than relying on said user to catch every single malicious email. For phishing, that may take the form of physical FIDO keys and secure email gateways.
This is similarly relevant for AI agents, which are imperfect autonomous processes that users may rely on to access sensitive information, or grant excessive permissions, or use to route insecure processes without proper oversight. Training users on how to use — or not use — their agent helpers is thus just one more layer of difficulty for security teams.
Who Is Responsible for My AI Agents?
Shared responsibility is a complex issue. On one hand, software vendors have long been criticized for putting too much of the security burden onto users while facing little to no culpability for selling insecure products. On the other, if an organization neglects basic security hygiene, it may not be fair to blame the vendor.
Related: Shutdown Sparks 85% Increase in US Government Cyberattacks
Itay Ravia, head of Aim Labs at Aim Security (an AI security vendor that previously disclosed a Copilot data exfiltration exploit dubbed &quot;EchoLeak&quot;), tells Dark Reading that in an ideal world, an AI agent would have gone through rigorous security testing. But the AI boom has created a &quot;race to make AI smarter, stronger, and more capable at the expense of security.&quot;
Ravia says agentic AI customers must take ownership of their security posture by ensuring the right guardrails are in place. Varonis field chief technology officer (CTO) Brian Vecci explains that the first thing to understand is, data isn&#x27;t stored in an AI agent directly, but rather within the enterprise data repositories that agents are granted access to.
&quot;That access control can be individual to the agent or the user(s) that are prompting it, and it&#x27;s the responsibility of the enterprise — not the agent&#x27;s vendor or the hyperscaler provider — to secure that data appropriately,&quot; he says. &quot;The shared responsibility model of data security is core to cloud and agentic services, and customers often struggle with managing that risk.&quot;
Melissa Ruzzi, director of AI at AppOmni, says that keeping data secure for AI agents should be considered akin to keeping data secure in software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications .
Related: Electronic Warfare Puts Commercial GPS Users on Notice
&quot;The provider is responsible for the security of the infrastructure itself, and the customer is responsible for securing the data and users,&quot; she says. &quot;The most important aspect to understand in AI applications is about the data flow and access, such as where data is coming from, where it’s going and who has access to it. Just because the data is being used by AI does not mean that a rigorous security review process can be skipped.&quot;
Though Ravia, Vecci, and Ruzzi offer different perspectives on the responsibility angle, together they paint a larger, more complex picture. As data is stored separately from the AI agent, it&#x27;s up to the user to ensure proper data security controls are in place when they hand over the keys to a non-human user. That said, vendors selling AI should ensure all measures are in place to limit the potential for an agent to leak sensitive data, a responsibility where some vendors falter.
Security Awareness: Saving AI Users From Themselves
Regardless of who&#x27;s to blame, AI-powered data exposures happen often enough that, like in the case of phishing, it&#x27;s worth asking whether AI vendors should begin to protect customers from themselves with things like mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) and secrets scanning.
Though by no means an industry standard, there are instances of such things happening; a Salesforce spokesperson tells Dark Reading that the company now requires all customers to use MFA with Salesforce products.
Aim Security&#x27;s Ravia says that although in recent months large vendors have begun to take their first steps toward deploying such protections, &quot;unfortunately, they are still well behind attackers and do not account for novel bypass methods .&quot; And, as Varonis&#x27; Vecci puts it, vendors like Salesforce and Microsoft that offer built-in AI agents can only secure perimeters.
David Brauchler, technical director and head of AI and machine learning security at consultancy NCC Group, tells Dark Reading that while responsibility for applying proper authentication and authorization controls falls on the organization using the agent, and the vendor is responsible for providing appropriate tools to enable the customer to manage access to AI systems — this is where it gets murky, from a user-awareness perspective.
&quot;AI vendors may reasonably enforce certain security best practices, but none of the tools available to vendors fundamentally solve the underlying data access problem,&quot; he says. &quot;Tools like secrets scanning and [data loss prevention] often lead to a false sense of security and a greater proliferation of vulnerabilities, resulting from a &#x27;the vendor will handle it&#x27; thought process. These problems fundamentally cannot be solved within the agentic model itself and need to be handled by the architecture of the customer’s AI infrastructure.&quot;
Bottom line? There have plenty of issues with the rollout of the AI in the past few years , and issues with how agentic AI products in particular are deployed into customer environments. So before an organization decides to invest in an agent or other LLM products to become an &quot;AI winner,&quot; it should put security first. The organization should know what data the agents have access to, ensure best practices and guardrails are in place, and have a full understanding of the risks of using the AI product and mitigating any risks.

&quot;That access control can be individual to the agent or the user(s) that are prompting it, and it&#x27;s the responsibility of the enterprise — not the agent&#x27;s vendor or the hyperscaler provider — to secure that data appropriately,&quot; he says. &quot;The shared responsibility model of data security is core to cloud and agentic services, and customers often struggle with managing that risk.&quot;
Melissa Ruzzi, director of AI at AppOmni, says that keeping data secure for AI agents should be considered akin to keeping data secure in software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications .

&quot;The provider is responsible for the security of the infrastructure itself, and the customer is responsible for securing the data and users,&quot; she says. &quot;The most important aspect to understand in AI applications is about the data flow and access, such as where data is coming from, where it’s going and who has access to it. Just because the data is being used by AI does not mean that a rigorous security review process can be skipped.&quot;
Though Ravia, Vecci, and Ruzzi offer different perspectives on the responsibility angle, together they paint a larger, more complex picture. As data is stored separately from the AI agent, it&#x27;s up to the user to ensure proper data security controls are in place when they hand over the keys to a non-human user. That said, vendors selling AI should ensure all measures are in place to limit the potential for an agent to leak sensitive data, a responsibility where some vendors falter.
Security Awareness: Saving AI Users From Themselves
Regardless of who&#x27;s to blame, AI-powered data exposures happen often enough that, like in the case of phishing, it&#x27;s worth asking whether AI vendors should begin to protect customers from themselves with things like mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) and secrets scanning.
Though by no means an industry standard, there are instances of such things happening; a Salesforce spokesperson tells Dark Reading that the company now requires all customers to use MFA with Salesforce products.
Aim Security&#x27;s Ravia says that although in recent months large vendors have begun to take their first steps toward deploying such protections, &quot;unfortunately, they are still well behind attackers and do not account for novel bypass methods .&quot; And, as Varonis&#x27; Vecci puts it, vendors like Salesforce and Microsoft that offer built-in AI agents can only secure perimeters.
David Brauchler, technical director and head of AI and machine learning security at consultancy NCC Group, tells Dark Reading that while responsibility for applying proper authentication and authorization controls falls on the organization using the agent, and the vendor is responsible for providing appropriate tools to enable the customer to manage access to AI systems — this is where it gets murky, from a user-awareness perspective.
&quot;AI vendors may reasonably enforce certain security best practices, but none of the tools available to vendors fundamentally solve the underlying data access problem,&quot; he says. &quot;Tools like secrets scanning and [data loss prevention] often lead to a false sense of security and a greater proliferation of vulnerabilities, resulting from a &#x27;the vendor will handle it&#x27; thought process. These problems fundamentally cannot be solved within the agentic model itself and need to be handled by the architecture of the customer’s AI infrastructure.&quot;
Bottom line? There have plenty of issues with the rollout of the AI in the past few years , and issues with how agentic AI products in particular are deployed into customer environments. So before an organization decides to invest in an agent or other LLM products to become an &quot;AI winner,&quot; it should put security first. The organization should know what data the agents have access to, ensure best practices and guardrails are in place, and have a full understanding of the risks of using the AI product and mitigating any risks.

AI Chat Data Is History&#x27;s Most Thorough Record of Enterprise Secrets. Secure It Wisely AI Chat Data Is History&#x27;s Most Thorough Record of Enterprise Secrets. Secure It Wisely AI Chat Data Is History&#x27;s Most Thorough Record of Enterprise Secrets. Secure It Wisely
AI interactions are becoming one of the most revealing records of human thinking, and we&#x27;re only beginning to understand what that means for law enforcement, accountability, and privacy.
October 17, 2025
COMMENTARY
Think about what you share with artificial intelligence agents like ChatGPT and Claude. Does that information include business ideas, venting about an interaction, travel plans, or even competitive research?
A vast and expanding trove of personal data is steadily being fed into AI chatbots that can be used to weave a clear picture of what you&#x27;re planning to do next.
Prosecutors unsealed arson and murder charges for the Palisades fire on Jan. 1, 2025, where 12 people died and thousands of homes were destroyed. Law enforcement used the suspect&#x27;s ChatGPT logs to build the case.
I believe that case sends a clear signal that intent is now traceable through chatbot records. Your interactions with AI are as sensitive as your personal diary — times 10.
DNA residue, fingerprints, everything you watch in crime shows pales in comparison to the private data that you have on your phone. Consider the added nuance and context that could be added to the data paired with records of real-time AI chatbot conversations.
ChatGPT and similar tools capture mindset, motive, and thoughts in progress better than any digital artifact we&#x27;ve had access to in history. ChatGPT has become a confessional, a planning board, and a mirror for intent. It captures moments in real time; showing how people think, build, and test as they go.
Related: It Takes Only 250 Documents to Poison Any AI Model
Before the Palisades fire, the suspect allegedly used ChatGPT to create images of burning forests and people running. During the 911 call, he reportedly asked ChatGPT, &quot;Are you at fault if a fire starts from your cigarette?&quot;
These interactions are being used by investigators to trace a narrative of the accused plan to carry out the crime. In the hands of an adversary, what could your organization&#x27;s AI chat records reveal about the business&#x27;s future plans?
Beyond trade secrets, every company where these LLMs are being regularly used are potentially generating new evidence every single day that could be used against it by law enforcement later.
Several AI companies have already indicated their ability to flag user activity that appears to foreshadow a crime, including OpenAI : &quot;In limited circumstances, OpenAI US and OpenAI Ireland may disclose user data to law enforcement agencies where it believes that making such a disclosure is necessary to prevent an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to a person.&quot;
AI companies including OpenAI and Anthropic are getting much better at detecting foreign adversaries using these systems for malicious ends, and I can only imagine that they&#x27;re doing similar for people in the US that may be looking to kill or commit acts of terror.

These companies aren&#x27;t doing press releases to announce they are engaged in proactive reporting to law enforcement. Rather, they prefer to spotlight efforts to disrupt state-affiliated threat actors in Russia, Iran, and China, which is much easier to get a pat on the back for.
Getting to &quot;Yes&quot; on AI … Securely
Now we need to talk about AI security.
Fellow security peers, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m seeing: Governance often becomes a system for denial and enables the &quot;Security Framework of No.&quot; I believe any business needs security to evolve into a structure that enables safe experimentation and learning. We&#x27;re running out of reasons to say no. Even highly regulated industries including banking, finance, and healthcare are already learning to say yes. They are testing, supervising, and building muscle for decentralized security.
I can&#x27;t see another way for a company to stay competitive and manage the shadow AI issue, unless the default answer to AI usage in the company is &quot;yes, unless the activity involves PII or restricted data.&quot; That mindset, from CEO to practitioner, keeps innovation visible and accountable.
Each refusal to allow for AI innovation in the interest of cybersecurity, pushes employees to personal accounts, other browsers, or private tools. The motivation toward these workarounds isn’t reckless disregard for security; they are trying to meet demand.
Related: Leaks in Microsoft VS Code Marketplace Put Supply Chain at Risk
Saying no rarely works anyway. AI is embedded across every platform. Blocking tools built into Chrome, Bing, or iPhone apps only hides activity still occurring.
When kids become teenagers, taking every device away fails. The better approach is teaching awareness of what&#x27;s safe, what&#x27;s risky, and what consequences look like. Governance should operate the same way, building awareness instead of enforcing control. Bans create false confidence. Block OneDrive links, and people email attachments. The data continues to move. Visibility disappears, and unseen risk grows.
How do we achieve this? If I had the perfect answer, I&#x27;d already be selling it.
One idea — security culture leans toward centralization, but AI already operates everywhere. What could distributed oversight look like? Decentralized security across each business unit. A security presence that observes, guides, and educates. Someone who can say, &quot;Hey, that too is uploading client data. Here’s why.&quot;
For security to remain relevant and keep the business competitive, the baseline must shift from &quot;no&quot; to &quot;yes, with guardrails.&quot; No one fully understands AI yet. Admitting that truth is where leadership starts.
As I write this, I&#x27;m remembering the movie Footloose . Rebellion grows when control tightens. The goal is not to stop the dance. It&#x27;s to ensure it happens safely.
I wrote the SANS Institute Secure AI Blueprint to address governance risk in AI adoption. It focuses on three pillars: Protect, Utilize, and Govern AI . This framework helps organizations design guardrails for AI systems through access control, auditability, model integrity, and human oversight.
I&#x27;d love your thoughts on all of this as we evolve. My DMs are open on LinkedIn .

These campaigns use social engineering and timing (e.g., holidays) to delay detection. This is a high-impact read for threat actors due to broad audience reach and low technical barriers.

Cyberattackers Target LastPass, Top Password Managers Cyberattackers Target LastPass, Top Password Managers Cyberattackers Target LastPass, Top Password Managers
Be aware: a rash of phishing campaigns are leveraging the anxiety and trust employees have in password vaults securing all of their credentials.
October 16, 2025
Major password managers are being impersonated in a spate of recent phishing attacks, including LastPass, Bitwarden, and 1Password, and enterprise users should be on notice. In a three-week span, all of them have been dealing with impersonation attacks by threat actors trying to con users into handing over their master password — and with it, troves of sensitive credentials.
Password management vendors have long been among hackers&#x27; favorite brands to impersonate, for good reason. Users need to have complete trust in their password managers — after all, nobody would store all of their credentials for all of their accounts in an app they didn&#x27;t have total confidence in. Phishers try to exploit that trust .
Because password managers are protected by a single master password, a password reset scam — &quot;Your password has been compromised, click here to reset it&quot; — might engender more fear and urgency in this context than in others with lower stakes (that is, unless the user understands the basic mechanics of how their manager works — namely, that their master password would never be stored online to begin with). And of course, if attackers can get their hands on just that one master password, they can access all of a user&#x27;s online accounts , plus all of the huge corporate systems they might afford access to.

Either by coincidence or reflecting a growing trend, password manager phishing attacks have been popping up even more than usual this October, cyber researchers are warning.
Fake 1Password Emails Hunting for Master Passwords
Earlier this year, threat actors targeted 1Password in a password reset phishing campaign . On Sept. 25, scam researcher Brett Christensen outed a new scam along similar lines .
The emails followed a tried-and-true format, informing users that their master password may have been compromised. To reset their password for security purposes, users were instructed to follow a link, where they would then enter their email address, the secret key associated with their account, their master password, and a replacement. That was all the information a hacker would need to log into 1Password as their victim, and steal all of their credentials to all of their online accounts.
On Oct. 2, a C-suite-level employee at Malwarebytes received an email quite similar to, but not exactly the same, as the one Christensen had described. Pieter Arntz, senior intelligence researcher at Malwarebytes, recalls that &quot; the attack was in so many ways similar that it might have been the same threat actors, but not exactly the same campaign.&quot; The gist of the email was the same, but this one referenced Watchtower, a feature of 1Password that scans users&#x27; saved passwords for weaknesses and breaches.
Related: Lazarus Group Hunts European Drone Manufacturing Data
Helpfully, though the email targeted a company executive, it did not target one who actually used 1Password, severely limiting the likelihood of compromise. There was also a variety of telltale signs that the email did not come from 1Password, including the sender domain — &quot;@eightninety.com&quot; — and the phishing site itself, which was taken offline the day after Malwarebytes received their email.
Phishy LastPass &amp; Bitwarden Emails
On Oct. 13, LastPass alerted users to a phishing campaign with a different spin to it.
In this case, hackers masquerading as LastPass told victims that the company had been hacked. In a creative interpretation of how the software actually works, the email explained that &quot;attackers exploited weaknesses in older .exe installations, which could, under certain conditions, allow unauthorized access to cached vault data.&quot; They added, &quot;out of caution,&quot; LastPass was releasing a new, more secure version of its desktop app, which users could supposedly download (by following a phishing link).
LastPass made note that the emails were concentrated during a holiday weekend (Indigenous Peoples/Columbus Day), which might have been an intentional move by the hackers, aimed at delaying security response times.
Related: MuddyWater Targets 100+ Gov Entities in MEA With Phoenix Backdoor
BleepingComputer employees found that the same threat actor has also been targeting users of LastPass competitor Bitwarden. The day after LastPass&#x27;s security notice went out, reporters received an email along much the same lines, purporting to come from Bitwarden.
Both sets of emails lured users into downloading Syncro, a legitimate software platform for IT teams and managed service providers (MSP). According to BleepingComputer&#x27;s analysis, the program was modified to hide its icon on a victim&#x27;s system tray, making the ruse a bit less obvious. Syncro&#x27;s sole purpose in the attack chain was to deploy a different remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool, ScreenConnect, which the attackers could use to remotely control victims&#x27; machines.
Oddly, then, unlike the 1Password campaign, there&#x27;s no particular reason why the attackers had to use password managers as a guise for their malware drops. Master passwords were not extracted at any point in the phishing logic.
Plan B, If You Lose Your Master Password
Of course, cyberattackers could still use an RMM to source credentials in a variety of ways, including by attempting to break into a password vault. But password managers aren&#x27;t entirely static, and can&#x27;t be completely undone even by a master password if configured in certain ways.
&quot;LastPass offers configurations that introduce friction into the authentication process to thwart attacker activity even if they do obtain valid customer credentials,&quot; says Alex Cox, director of the Threat Intelligence, Mitigation, Escalation (TIME) team at LastPass. Employees have the option to utilize a variety of multifactor authentication (MFA) protections, including passkeys and hardware tokens, and app alerts can block account logins from unrecognized locations.
Different Plan Bs might make sense for different enterprises, so, Cox says, &quot;we encourage our customers to enable the items that make the most sense for their threat environment.&quot;

Leaks in Microsoft VS Code Marketplace Put Supply Chain at Risk Leaks in Microsoft VS Code Marketplace Put Supply Chain at Risk Leaks in Microsoft VS Code Marketplace Put Supply Chain at Risk
Researchers discovered more than 550 unique secrets exposed in Visual Studio Code marketplaces, prompting Microsoft to bolster security measures.
October 16, 2025
UPDATE
Organizations have accidentally exposed secrets across Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) marketplaces, posing significant risks not just to the organizations themselves but also to the greater software supply chain.
In a blog post on Wednesday, Wiz detailed how its research team discovered a pattern of secret leakage by organizations that published extensions for VS Code , a source code editor developed by Microsoft. Rami McCarthy, principal security researcher at Wiz, began examining Microsoft&#x27;s VSCode Marketplace earlier this year after threat actors attempted to introduce malicious extensions .
&quot;While we did end up identifying several interesting malicious extensions, we stumbled on something much more impactful: a scourge of secrets leaking in extension packages,&quot; McCarthy wrote in the blog post .
The research team also examined the Open VSX Registry, an open source alternative to the VS Code Marketplace managed by the Eclipse Foundation . The researchers found more than 550 validated secrets from hundreds of extension publishers, many of which were from AI providers such as OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, XAI, DeepSeek, HuggingFace, and Perplexity.
Extension Files Full of Secrets
VS Code extensions are distributed in marketplaces as a .vsix package, which is a zipped archive file. These files, he noted, can be unzipped and inspected. Yet extension publishers often included sensitive data in them, McCarthy wrote, either because they&#x27;re unaware the packages are fully public or because they failed to scan for hardcoded secrets before submitting the extensions.

The most critical secrets discovered by the research team were access tokens that allowed users to update the extensions. These tokens included the Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for Microsoft&#x27;s VS Code Marketplace, and open-vsx.org access tokens. Such tokens could give unauthorized individuals the ability to poison extensions and conduct a massive supply chain attack.
More than 130 such tokens were discovered by the research team. In some cases, Wiz found that leaky extensions from large companies — but with very low download counts — were internal company or vendor-specific extensions.
&quot;Internal extensions should not be distributed publicly, but often are for convenience,&quot; McCarthy wrote. &quot;In one case, we found a VSCode Marketplace PAT that would allow us to push targeted malware to the workforce of a $30 billion market cap Chinese megacorp.&quot;
McCarthy noted that Wiz saw an increase of exposed secrets contained in AI-related configuration files. Additionally, the research team found database secrets for platforms such as MongoDB, Postgres, and Supabase, as well as &quot;high risk&quot; platform secrets for AWS, Github, Stripe, Auth0, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). McCarthy tells Dark Reading the high-risk secrets included access token and API keys.

Microsoft Clamps Down on Spilled Secrets
Leaked secrets have become a growing concern in the infosec community as attackers have increasingly targeted software repositories and scoured them for credentials and other sensitive data. But McCarthy says he was surprised to find so many secrets lurking in the extension marketplaces, and it&#x27;s likely that Microsoft was caught off guard as well because there were initially no measures in place to detect them.
&quot;Not only was there no evidence of prior scanning, but much of the existing research around VSCode extensions has focused on malware and overlooked this substantial, more critical risk,&quot; he says. &quot;Structurally, though, this is exactly the sort of place we&#x27;ve historically seen mass secrets leakage.&quot;
Wiz reported the leaked secrets to Microsoft in late March and early April and later collaborated with the company on addressing the issue. McCarthy noted that every leaked VS Code Marketplace PAT has been revoked. In June, Microsoft unveiled new security measures for the VS Code Marketplace that included tools for publishers to scan extensions for secrets before they are published.

Microsoft also scanned all existing extensions in the marketplace and will work with organizations to publish new, sanitized code. McCarthy noted that Open VSX Registry is adding a new prefix to its access tokens, but it&#x27;s unclear if the Eclipse Foundation has revoked the exposed tokens or taken additional measures to prevent secrets from being exposed.
Thabang Mashologu, vice president of marketing and products at the Eclipse Foundation, tells Dark Reading that the organization was not contacted by Wiz prior to the publication of the blog post, and as a result Eclipse did not have an opportunity to review the findings related to the Open VSX Registry.
Mashologu says the Eclipse Foundation has taken action to address threats to the broader software supply chain, including the launch earlier this year of a dedicated security improvement initiative for the Open VSX Registry service. The initiative implemented pre-publish security checks, automated secret scanning, name-squatting detection, and malware screening.
&quot;We are also evaluating token expiration periods and expanding proactive monitoring. These steps are part of a broader effort to continuously improve the security, reliability, and transparency of Open VSX as a trusted open source resource for developers and organizations worldwide,&quot; Mashologu says. &quot;We recognize that maintaining secure open infrastructure requires sustained investment, collaboration, and responsible stewardship, even within the limits of available resources. This work reflects our commitment to strengthening the global software supply chain while remaining transparent and community-driven.&quot;
McCarthy encouraged organizations to use the VS Code Marketplace for sourcing extensions because it &quot;has higher review rigor and controls currently, over the OpenVSX Marketplace.&quot;
McCarthy also recommended limiting the number of installed VS Code extensions and considering using an allow list for them; creating an inventory for integrated development environment (IDE) extensions; and carefully reviewing extensions&#x27; trust criteria, such as installations, reviews, publisher reputation, and other metadata before installing.
This story was updated at 11:30 p.m. ET on Oct. 22 to reflect statements from the Eclipse Foundation.

Leaks in Microsoft VS Code Marketplace Put Supply Chain at Risk Leaks in Microsoft VS Code Marketplace Put Supply Chain at Risk Leaks in Microsoft VS Code Marketplace Put Supply Chain at Risk
Researchers discovered more than 550 unique secrets exposed in Visual Studio Code marketplaces, prompting Microsoft to bolster security measures.
October 16, 2025
UPDATE
Organizations have accidentally exposed secrets across Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) marketplaces, posing significant risks not just to the organizations themselves but also to the greater software supply chain.
In a blog post on Wednesday, Wiz detailed how its research team discovered a pattern of secret leakage by organizations that published extensions for VS Code , a source code editor developed by Microsoft. Rami McCarthy, principal security researcher at Wiz, began examining Microsoft&#x27;s VSCode Marketplace earlier this year after threat actors attempted to introduce malicious extensions .
&quot;While we did end up identifying several interesting malicious extensions, we stumbled on something much more impactful: a scourge of secrets leaking in extension packages,&quot; McCarthy wrote in the blog post .
The research team also examined the Open VSX Registry, an open source alternative to the VS Code Marketplace managed by the Eclipse Foundation . The researchers found more than 550 validated secrets from hundreds of extension publishers, many of which were from AI providers such as OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, XAI, DeepSeek, HuggingFace, and Perplexity.
Extension Files Full of Secrets
VS Code extensions are distributed in marketplaces as a .vsix package, which is a zipped archive file. These files, he noted, can be unzipped and inspected. Yet extension publishers often included sensitive data in them, McCarthy wrote, either because they&#x27;re unaware the packages are fully public or because they failed to scan for hardcoded secrets before submitting the extensions.

The most critical secrets discovered by the research team were access tokens that allowed users to update the extensions. These tokens included the Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for Microsoft&#x27;s VS Code Marketplace, and open-vsx.org access tokens. Such tokens could give unauthorized individuals the ability to poison extensions and conduct a massive supply chain attack.
More than 130 such tokens were discovered by the research team. In some cases, Wiz found that leaky extensions from large companies — but with very low download counts — were internal company or vendor-specific extensions.
&quot;Internal extensions should not be distributed publicly, but often are for convenience,&quot; McCarthy wrote. &quot;In one case, we found a VSCode Marketplace PAT that would allow us to push targeted malware to the workforce of a $30 billion market cap Chinese megacorp.&quot;
McCarthy noted that Wiz saw an increase of exposed secrets contained in AI-related configuration files. Additionally, the research team found database secrets for platforms such as MongoDB, Postgres, and Supabase, as well as &quot;high risk&quot; platform secrets for AWS, Github, Stripe, Auth0, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). McCarthy tells Dark Reading the high-risk secrets included access token and API keys.

Microsoft Clamps Down on Spilled Secrets
Leaked secrets have become a growing concern in the infosec community as attackers have increasingly targeted software repositories and scoured them for credentials and other sensitive data. But McCarthy says he was surprised to find so many secrets lurking in the extension marketplaces, and it&#x27;s likely that Microsoft was caught off guard as well because there were initially no measures in place to detect them.
&quot;Not only was there no evidence of prior scanning, but much of the existing research around VSCode extensions has focused on malware and overlooked this substantial, more critical risk,&quot; he says. &quot;Structurally, though, this is exactly the sort of place we&#x27;ve historically seen mass secrets leakage.&quot;
Wiz reported the leaked secrets to Microsoft in late March and early April and later collaborated with the company on addressing the issue. McCarthy noted that every leaked VS Code Marketplace PAT has been revoked. In June, Microsoft unveiled new security measures for the VS Code Marketplace that included tools for publishers to scan extensions for secrets before they are published.

Microsoft also scanned all existing extensions in the marketplace and will work with organizations to publish new, sanitized code. McCarthy noted that Open VSX Registry is adding a new prefix to its access tokens, but it&#x27;s unclear if the Eclipse Foundation has revoked the exposed tokens or taken additional measures to prevent secrets from being exposed.
Thabang Mashologu, vice president of marketing and products at the Eclipse Foundation, tells Dark Reading that the organization was not contacted by Wiz prior to the publication of the blog post, and as a result Eclipse did not have an opportunity to review the findings related to the Open VSX Registry.
Mashologu says the Eclipse Foundation has taken action to address threats to the broader software supply chain, including the launch earlier this year of a dedicated security improvement initiative for the Open VSX Registry service. The initiative implemented pre-publish security checks, automated secret scanning, name-squatting detection, and malware screening.
&quot;We are also evaluating token expiration periods and expanding proactive monitoring. These steps are part of a broader effort to continuously improve the security, reliability, and transparency of Open VSX as a trusted open source resource for developers and organizations worldwide,&quot; Mashologu says. &quot;We recognize that maintaining secure open infrastructure requires sustained investment, collaboration, and responsible stewardship, even within the limits of available resources. This work reflects our commitment to strengthening the global software supply chain while remaining transparent and community-driven.&quot;
McCarthy encouraged organizations to use the VS Code Marketplace for sourcing extensions because it &quot;has higher review rigor and controls currently, over the OpenVSX Marketplace.&quot;
McCarthy also recommended limiting the number of installed VS Code extensions and considering using an allow list for them; creating an inventory for integrated development environment (IDE) extensions; and carefully reviewing extensions&#x27; trust criteria, such as installations, reviews, publisher reputation, and other metadata before installing.
This story was updated at 11:30 p.m. ET on Oct. 22 to reflect statements from the Eclipse Foundation.

China Hackers Test AI-Optimized Attack Chains in Taiwan China Hackers Test AI-Optimized Attack Chains in Taiwan China Hackers Test AI-Optimized Attack Chains in Taiwan
AI might help some threat actors in certain respects, but one group is proving that its use for cyberattacks has its limits.
October 16, 2025
A Chinese threat actor has been testing out whether artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance its cyberattacks against Taiwan.
The AI revolution in cyber threats has been long heralded though little observed. For some years now, prognosticators have been warning about incoming AI-generated malware, exploitation techniques, even full attack chains right around the corner. In that time, though, there&#x27;s been scattered evidence of AI helping threat actors with much beyond research , very basic coding, and prosaic phishing emails.
In an October update on its efforts to secure its own technology from threat actors, OpenAI took ample room to discuss &quot;UNK_DropPitch,&quot; a Chinese state-aligned threat actor. DropPitch has been trying to match the AI hype, using ChatGPT and a bit of DeepSeek to generate phishing emails and enhance its backdoor malware.
In a report shared exclusively with Dark Reading, Proofpoint revealed the results of DropPitch&#x27;s experiment with ChatGPT: unqualified failure.
&quot;You&#x27;re seeing some state-aligned actors use AI in different ways,&quot; Alexis Dorais-Joncas, senior manager of threat research for Proofpoint, told a room of reporters at the company&#x27;s Predict 2025 conference in Nashville. In the case of DropPitch, he said, &quot;the results were questionable at best. Terrible-looking phishing emails. So you know, AI used by incompetent people will lead to incompetent results.&quot;

DropPitch Cyberattacks Target Taiwanese Orgs
DropPitch is low down the pecking order among Chinese state-associated threat actors, perhaps more creative than sophisticated.
In April and May, 2025, it was observed attacking the Taiwanese semiconductor industry. Rather than manufacturers, or government or defense agencies, though, it went after major investment firms in Taiwan&#x27;s semiconductor space . That was a circuitous way to undermine the country, and if not for its tactics, techniques, or procedures (TTPs), DropPitch was at least remarkable in that regard.
The researchers now report that, following their initial batch of research, DropPitch activity increased &quot;significantly.&quot; Its attacks became higher-volume and persistent — pestering the same targets week after week, and sometimes many times in the same day. Their target list also expanded. In June and July, the group targeted the finance and semiconductor sectors, academics and think tanks, in both Taiwan and the US. OpenAI also saw targeting of other organizations associated with ethnic and political groups critical of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)

In retrospect, the attackers were probably able to do so much more by leaning heavily on ChatGPT.
A ChatGPT (De-)Optimized Cyberattack
Like other threat actors before it, DropPitch used ChatGPT to generate phishing emails. The aim was to design emails in a variety of languages, which appeared to come from relevant personas for their target audience. For example, researchers seeking collaboration was a common theme.
Some of the resulting emails victims received were downright inexplicable. In some cases, the body of the email was written three times over in three different languages. Some included mismatched or obviously scammy contact details, email signatures, and metadata. Their content sometimes didn&#x27;t match the occasion, like the one pretending to come from Pornhub&#x27;s casting team. Other times, the email and the malicious document attached didn&#x27;t align.
The hackers also asked ChatGPT for help optimizing its rudimentary custom backdoor, &quot;HealthKick.&quot; They wanted snippets of code that could help gather information from victim machines, run Powershell scripts, and make their code more evasive. They conversed with the AI at length about using AES to secure their command-and-control (C2) traffic, and asked for code that&#x27;d help them upgrade their C2 traffic from WebSockets and HTTP to secure WebSockets and HTTPS. They asked for help in integrating open source (OSS) scanning tools
Related: Charon Ransomware Emerges With APT-Style Tactics
At one point, the hackers explored how they might use AI to automatically analyze Web content, generate a list of emails belonging to their targets, and tailor content to target them with. But ChatGPT stopped short of offering overtly nefarious advice of the kind, or any uniquely malicious code that would help. Comically, the threat actors then asked it if DeepSeek could help them instead.
As with the emails, the resulting backdoor came out with…quirks. Its C2 protocol was bespoke but very basic, it used two separate sets of fake TLS headers for no discernible reason, and the archive files it came packaged in also sometimes contained totally random and purposeless audio and video recordings, explicit images, and nonsensical text files.
DropPitch Drops ChatGPT as a Conduit
DropPitch&#x27;s own feelings and takeaways from its AI experiment were revealed when it switched tactics yet again, late in July. Since then the group&#x27;s activity has slowed down again, its phishing emails have returned to normal, and it&#x27;s now trying to engage victims person-to-person before infecting them with malware. In other words, it&#x27;s going back to old, tried and true tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
In the end, DropPitch is perhaps the most obvious case study in a recently obvious phenomenon: that threat actors just aren&#x27;t weaponizing AI like we thought they would.
&quot;There is a fundamental conundrum when it comes to AI, and it’s not just a cybersecurity problem, it’s a unilateral problem across all industries,&quot; argues Daniel Blackford, vice president of threat research at Proofpoint. In essence, businesses are facing the same problem the hackers are. &quot;We have visible, tangible evidence of the capability of the technology to perform certain functions and recognize that it will be transformational, we have some imagination for ways that transformation could proceed, but the transformation hasn’t been fully realized yet. And it’s not even necessarily easy to speak to more than a handful of immediate (tactical) changes a business can make, to then forecast from there directions the technology could go.&quot;
In other words, whether in cyber campaigns or product marketing campaigns, &quot;transformational&quot; and &quot;game-changing&quot; AI is still largely theoretical.
Blackford adds that hackers are likely to trail businesses in AI adoption, because &quot;to some extent threat actors are by definition forced into the same limitations as their intended victim set. You can’t jailbreak or poison or reverse engineer an agent or MCP server full of agents until those things are actually deployed and made accessible in the environments of the victims an actor gains access to.&quot;
&quot;The rate of evolution of the models is breakneck,&quot; he says, so the landscape could shift at any moment. &quot;However, the models are tools, not exhaustive application of tools or outcomes.&quot;

LevelBlue Announces Plans to Acquire XDR Provider Cybereason LevelBlue Announces Plans to Acquire XDR Provider Cybereason LevelBlue Announces Plans to Acquire XDR Provider Cybereason
The deal, which builds on LevelBlue&#x27;s recent acquisition of Trustwave and Aon, aims to provide customers with a broad portfolio of extended detection and response, managed detection and response, and forensic services.
October 15, 2025
LevelBlue, a managed security service provider spun out of AT&amp;T last year , announced plans on Tuesday to acquire extended detection and response (XDR) platform provider Cybereason as part of its push to broaden its global managed services portfolio.
Cybereason&#x27;s products and services will provide LevelBlue with a higher degree of offensive and defensive capabilities, which will enhance its penetration testing, risk assessment, detection engineering, and persistent monitoring capabilities, according to the acquisition announcement. The Cybereason Defense Platform is designed to predict, understand, and curtail malicious operations. Its core engine, MalOp, uses AI-based capabilities to provide rapid detection and response, analyze event data, and offer automated &quot;single-click&quot; remediation.
&quot;By combining Cybereason&#x27;s world-class XDR and DFIR capabilities with our AI-powered MDR and incident response, we can deliver unified protection that&#x27;s proactive, scalable, and purpose-built for today&#x27;s fast-evolving threats,&quot; said LevelBlue chairman and CEO Bob McCullen in a statement.
LevelBlue also said Cybereason&#x27;s Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) technology and services will enhance the risk assessment offerings LevelBlue acquired as part of the Aon acquisition earlier this year. The risk assessment offering was from Stroz Friedberg, which was originally launched in 2000 by onetime FBI Special Agent Ed Stroz and former prosecutor Eric Friedberg. Aon acquired Stroz Friedberg in 2016.

Terms of the LevelBlue-Cybereason deal were not disclosed, but the acquisition announcement comes just months after LevelBlue acquired managed detection and response (MDR) provider TrustWave . Prior to that acquisition, Trustwave and Cybereason had been in merger talks. In the October 2024 announcement, Cybereason and Trustwave highlighted their complementary products and services, signaling plans to provide a broad set of MDR, offensive security capabilities, incident response, forensics, and threat intelligence offerings. The Cybereason-Trustwave merger was called off earlier this year after a dispute among Cybereason board members.
Back when the Trustwave-Cybereason deal fell apart and LevelBlue acquired Trustwave, McCullen told Dark Reading that Trustwave was a good fit for LevelBlue. The plan was to integrate LevelBlue&#x27;s cybersecurity infrastructure with Trustwave&#x27;s Fusion, a cloud-native, unified security operations platform that features a data lake, providing centralized visibility into an enterprise&#x27;s security stack. LevelBlue also gained Trustwave&#x27;s SpiderLabs threat research and intelligence group.

When Dark Reading asked McCullen about future plans or deals, McCullen didn&#x27;t indicate that Cybereason was also a target.
&quot;I don&#x27;t know, we might take a break to digest what we got there,&quot; McCullen said at the time. &quot;But we&#x27;ve got a history of being acquisitive, so we&#x27;ll be on the lookout.&quot;
It turns out that Cybereason and Trustwave will come together as one company, after all, as part of LevelBlue.
It was not immediately clear if or when LevelBlue will integrate Cybereason&#x27;s XDR platform with Trustwave&#x27;s Fusion. According to the announcement, LevelBlue will combine Cybereason&#x27;s research team with Trustwave SpiderLabs, aiming to provide increased visibility and insights into new threat actors and attack techniques.

&#x27;Mysterious Elephant&#x27; Moves Beyond Recycled Malware &#x27;Mysterious Elephant&#x27; Moves Beyond Recycled Malware &#x27;Mysterious Elephant&#x27; Moves Beyond Recycled Malware
The cyber-espionage group has been using sophisticated custom tools to target government and diplomatic entities in South Asia since early 2025.
October 15, 2025
A cyberespionage group that initially relied on malware code from other hacking outfits has evolved into a sophisticated threat operation wielding its own arsenal of custom tools, targeting government agencies and diplomatic entities across South Asia.
Kaspersky researchers, tracking the group as &quot;Mysterious Elephant,&quot; observed the tactical shift in a campaign beginning early this year, with the attackers deploying proprietary malware and new techniques to steal sensitive data including documents, images, and files from WhatsApp communications.
A Rogue Elephant in South Asia
Mysterious Elephant&#x27;s targets so far have included entities in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and, to a smaller extent, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.
&quot;The group&#x27;s victimology is characterized by a high degree of specificity,&quot; Kaspersky researcher Noushin Shabab wrote in a blog post this week. The attackers have been using highly customized spear-phishing emails and decoy documents — such as one that purported to be about Pakistan&#x27;s application to be a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council — to target individuals at organizations of interest. &quot;Once inside, they employ a range of tools and techniques to escalate privileges, move laterally, and exfiltrate sensitive information.&quot;

Kaspersky&#x27;s report did not attribute Mysterious Elephant to any specific nation-state or government; the company did not immediately respond to Dark Reading&#x27;s requests for comment about that. However, the security vendor&#x27;s report identified Mysterious Elephant&#x27;s early malware code as having overlaps with code from multiple groups, including Origami Elephant , Confucius , and SideWinder , all of which are threat actors that other vendors have linked to India. Kaspersky itself has interpreted the code overlaps as suggesting a tight collaboration and shared infrastructure use between Mysterious Elephant and these other groups.
While Kaspersky stopped short of linking the group to any specific government, its report highlighted several advances that Mysterious Elephant has made to its tool kit and tactics.
Kaspersky&#x27;s analysis showed Mysterious Elephant is using a compact, multistage toolkit that combines both open source and custom code to maintain access and move laterally. For initial access, the group has been using highly tailored spear-phishing emails containing decoy documents that trigger the infection chain once opened.
Once on a system, the attackers use a PowerShell script loaded by legitimate tools, like curl/certutil, as the initial downloader and installer. The loader establishes contact with its command and control (C2) server, from which the attackers then deploy a C++ reverse shell that Kaspersky dubbed BabShell. The bespoke tool gathers detailed system information and also enables the attacker to maintain interactive control over the compromised system and execute commands of their choice on it, including those for download additional payloads.

Custom Malware Tools
One of the additional payloads that BabShell downloads is a reflective PE loader, which basically is code that can load and run a Windows executable directly in memory, so the payload never touches disk. Kasperksy found the loader, dubbed MemLoader HidenDesk, performing anti-analysis checks, creating a hidden environment on the compromised system from which to operate, and downloading the commercial Remcos remote access tool. Another new loader that Kaspersky observed Mysterious Elephant using is MemLoader Edge, which the attacker uses to install another backdoor called VRAT.
When the attackers have their in-memory implants and hands-on access in place, they use modules specifically designed to steal sensitive documents, files, images, and other data from WhatsApp, which is widely used in the region for business purposes and official communications.

One of them is Uplo, a tool that scans infected systems for valuable file types like documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, archives, and images, and then automatically uploads them to the attackers&#x27; C2 servers. Another, dubbed Stom, targets WhatsApp&#x27;s Desktop folder, in addition to other folders and secondary drives on the infected system, while a third, ChromeStealer Exfiltrator, steals Google Chrome browser data and locally stored information including WhatsApp Web data from the browser.
For infrastructure, Kaspersky observed Mysterious Elephant using what is known as wildcard DNS to generate unique domains for each victim, making tracking and monitoring difficult. &quot;Mysterious Elephant is a highly sophisticated and active advanced persistent threat group that poses a significant threat to government entities and foreign affairs sectors in the Asia-Pacific region,&quot; Shabab said.
Mysterious Elephant is among a growing roster of APT groups operating in Asia. While China and North Korea dominate the landscape, other nations in the region, including India and Pakistan, have been developing their own cyberespionage and influence operations as well.
The key to staying ahead of such threats, as Kaspersky noted in its report, is to have a multilayered defense strategy that leverages threat intelligence to understand and defend against specific threat-actor tactics, techniques, and procedures.

&#x27;Mysterious Elephant&#x27; Moves Beyond Recycled Malware &#x27;Mysterious Elephant&#x27; Moves Beyond Recycled Malware &#x27;Mysterious Elephant&#x27; Moves Beyond Recycled Malware
The cyber-espionage group has been using sophisticated custom tools to target government and diplomatic entities in South Asia since early 2025.
October 15, 2025
A cyberespionage group that initially relied on malware code from other hacking outfits has evolved into a sophisticated threat operation wielding its own arsenal of custom tools, targeting government agencies and diplomatic entities across South Asia.
Kaspersky researchers, tracking the group as &quot;Mysterious Elephant,&quot; observed the tactical shift in a campaign beginning early this year, with the attackers deploying proprietary malware and new techniques to steal sensitive data including documents, images, and files from WhatsApp communications.
A Rogue Elephant in South Asia
Mysterious Elephant&#x27;s targets so far have included entities in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and, to a smaller extent, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.
&quot;The group&#x27;s victimology is characterized by a high degree of specificity,&quot; Kaspersky researcher Noushin Shabab wrote in a blog post this week. The attackers have been using highly customized spear-phishing emails and decoy documents — such as one that purported to be about Pakistan&#x27;s application to be a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council — to target individuals at organizations of interest. &quot;Once inside, they employ a range of tools and techniques to escalate privileges, move laterally, and exfiltrate sensitive information.&quot;

Kaspersky&#x27;s report did not attribute Mysterious Elephant to any specific nation-state or government; the company did not immediately respond to Dark Reading&#x27;s requests for comment about that. However, the security vendor&#x27;s report identified Mysterious Elephant&#x27;s early malware code as having overlaps with code from multiple groups, including Origami Elephant , Confucius , and SideWinder , all of which are threat actors that other vendors have linked to India. Kaspersky itself has interpreted the code overlaps as suggesting a tight collaboration and shared infrastructure use between Mysterious Elephant and these other groups.
While Kaspersky stopped short of linking the group to any specific government, its report highlighted several advances that Mysterious Elephant has made to its tool kit and tactics.
Kaspersky&#x27;s analysis showed Mysterious Elephant is using a compact, multistage toolkit that combines both open source and custom code to maintain access and move laterally. For initial access, the group has been using highly tailored spear-phishing emails containing decoy documents that trigger the infection chain once opened.
Once on a system, the attackers use a PowerShell script loaded by legitimate tools, like curl/certutil, as the initial downloader and installer. The loader establishes contact with its command and control (C2) server, from which the attackers then deploy a C++ reverse shell that Kaspersky dubbed BabShell. The bespoke tool gathers detailed system information and also enables the attacker to maintain interactive control over the compromised system and execute commands of their choice on it, including those for download additional payloads.

Custom Malware Tools
One of the additional payloads that BabShell downloads is a reflective PE loader, which basically is code that can load and run a Windows executable directly in memory, so the payload never touches disk. Kasperksy found the loader, dubbed MemLoader HidenDesk, performing anti-analysis checks, creating a hidden environment on the compromised system from which to operate, and downloading the commercial Remcos remote access tool. Another new loader that Kaspersky observed Mysterious Elephant using is MemLoader Edge, which the attacker uses to install another backdoor called VRAT.
When the attackers have their in-memory implants and hands-on access in place, they use modules specifically designed to steal sensitive documents, files, images, and other data from WhatsApp, which is widely used in the region for business purposes and official communications.

One of them is Uplo, a tool that scans infected systems for valuable file types like documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, archives, and images, and then automatically uploads them to the attackers&#x27; C2 servers. Another, dubbed Stom, targets WhatsApp&#x27;s Desktop folder, in addition to other folders and secondary drives on the infected system, while a third, ChromeStealer Exfiltrator, steals Google Chrome browser data and locally stored information including WhatsApp Web data from the browser.
For infrastructure, Kaspersky observed Mysterious Elephant using what is known as wildcard DNS to generate unique domains for each victim, making tracking and monitoring difficult. &quot;Mysterious Elephant is a highly sophisticated and active advanced persistent threat group that poses a significant threat to government entities and foreign affairs sectors in the Asia-Pacific region,&quot; Shabab said.
Mysterious Elephant is among a growing roster of APT groups operating in Asia. While China and North Korea dominate the landscape, other nations in the region, including India and Pakistan, have been developing their own cyberespionage and influence operations as well.
The key to staying ahead of such threats, as Kaspersky noted in its report, is to have a multilayered defense strategy that leverages threat intelligence to understand and defend against specific threat-actor tactics, techniques, and procedures.

F5 BIG-IP Environment Breached by Nation-State Actor F5 BIG-IP Environment Breached by Nation-State Actor F5 BIG-IP Environment Breached by Nation-State Actor
F5 disclosed a breach this week that included zero-day bugs, source code, and some customer information.
October 15, 2025
Application security giant F5 disclosed a data breach this week in which a nation-state threat actor gained persistent, long-term access to the company&#x27;s product development environment and engineering knowledge management platforms for its flagship BIG-IP application delivery and security products, before exfiltrating data.
The company disclosed the breach in a post on its customer-focused MyF5 website on Oct. 15. F5 said it learned in August that &quot;a highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to, and downloaded files from, certain F5 systems.&quot;
The unnamed threat actor exfiltrated files containing some BIG-IP source code as well as information regarding undisclosed vulnerabilities it was currently mitigating. The company did not describe the content of said vulnerabilities, only adding in the disclosure post that &quot;we have no knowledge of undisclosed critical or remote code vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of active exploitation of any undisclosed F5 vulnerabilities.&quot;
Regarding its knowledge management platform, some exfiltrated files contained configuration and implementation information for a &quot;small percentage&quot; of customers, it said. F5 is reviewing the files and contacting customers directly &quot;as appropriate.&quot;
Related: US Crypto Bust Offers Hope in Battle Against Cybercrime Syndicates
As for what the threat actor did not get access to, F5 has not found evidence of access to or exfiltration of data tied to its CRM, financial, support case management, or iHealth systems, nor the NGINX source code or product development environment .
In addition, F5 has identified no evidence of modification to its software supply chain, including source code, build pipeline, and release pipeline; and it included letters of attestation from NCC Group and IOActive to support the claim.
Risk Remains for Potential Data Breach Security Fallout
Although customer impact seems limited for now, any long-term, persistent threat activity from a sophisticated nation-state actor constitutes a worst-case scenario for an organization.
As F5 said, there is no evidence of follow-on or supply-chain activity resulting from this attack. But concerns remain that vulnerability and source code data stolen today could be utilized in other attacks tomorrow, warns Will Baxter, field chief information security officer (CISO) at Team Cymru.
&quot;This is similar to the SolarWinds attack as the actors will use the exfiltrated source code and configs to exploit customers in future campaigns,&quot; Baxter says. &quot;This is likely just the beginning of what we will see in terms of a long-term persistent attack at F5, or more likely against F5 devices across customer environments.&quot;

Regarding possible motives behind the attack, David Lindner, CISO of application security vendor Contrast Security, tells Dark Reading that the threat actor&#x27;s reason for long-term persistence was more likely for spying purposes than stealing files that it could sell. The identity of the threat actor behind the attack remains unclear, though some have pointed to China as a possible culprit, based on previous targeting of F5 appliances .
&quot;Their goal likely wasn&#x27;t to break things at F5 but to gather intelligence for some future plan. By stealing source code from the BIG-IP development team, they essentially grabbed the architectural blueprints for a technology that governments and huge companies rely on globally,&quot; he says. &quot;This information is gold for them. They can use it to find undiscovered flaws to use in a later attack, or even map out a major supply chain compromise. This also explains why they were so quiet.&quot;
What F5 Customers Can Do About the Data Breach
In the wake of the breach, F5 said it has worked with multiple incident response firms as well as law enforcement to mitigate the event, and that based on extensive action taken, it believes it has contained the threat posed by the nation-state actor. It also shared an 8-K filing with investors.

Beyond basic remediation, F5 said it rotated credentials and strengthened its access controls across systems, deployed improved inventory and patch management automation, integrated better monitoring and detection tools, implemented enhancements to network security infrastructure, hardened its product development environment, and more.
&quot;Your trust matters. We know it is earned every day, especially when things go wrong,&quot; the company said in its blog posting. &quot;We truly regret that this incident occurred and the risk it may create for you. We are committed to learning from this incident and sharing those lessons with the broader security community.&quot;
F5 advises that customers apply the latest BIG-IP updates. It also shared various guidance for hardening customers&#x27; systems.
On Oct. 15, CISA directed federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies to inventory F5 BIG-IP products and apply updates where necessary.
Some questions about the breach still remain, including how the threat actor managed to get into F5 systems in the first place, and how the company finally caught on to the compromise. Dark Reading asked F5 how it detected the threat actor, but a spokesperson declined to comment beyond the initial disclosure post.

Harvard University Breached in Oracle Zero-Day Attack Harvard University Breached in Oracle Zero-Day Attack Harvard University Breached in Oracle Zero-Day Attack
The Clop ransomware group claimed responsibility for stealing the university&#x27;s data as part of a broader campaign against Oracle customers.
October 15, 2025
Harvard University confirmed that it fell victim to an attack exploiting the recently disclosed zero-day vulnerability in Oracle&#x27;s E-Business Suite (EBS) system.
The critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-61882, allows an attacker without authentication to remotely access EBS instances. The flaw has been exploited by the notorious Clop ransomware gang in attacks on Oracle customers .
&quot;Harvard is aware of reports that data associated with the University has been obtained as a result of a zero-day vulnerability in the Oracle E-Business Suite system,&quot; the University told Dark Reading. &quot;This issue has impacted many Oracle E-Business Suite customers and is not specific to Harvard. While the investigation is ongoing, we believe that this incident impacts a limited number of parties associated with a small administrative unit.&quot;
Authorities in the US and UK have issued warnings regarding exploitation of CVE-2025-61882 , with FBI Assistant Director Brett Leatherman going so far as to describe the bug in a LinkedIn post as a &quot;stop what you’re doing and patch immediately&quot; vulnerability.
The Ivy League university said it applied the patch after Oracle issued the update. While it continues to monitor the situation, Harvard said it has found no evidence of further compromise to its other systems.

Oracle Patches Another Flaw Amid Clop Attacks
Just a few days ago, Clop added Harvard to its Dark Web leak site, claiming it had stolen a host of the university&#x27;s data. The breach is part of a greater campaign that began on Sept. 29, according to Google&#x27;s Threat Intelligence Group and Mandiant.
&quot;Our analysis indicates that the CL0P extortion campaign followed months of intrusion activity targeting EBS customer environments,&quot; said the researchers . &quot;The threat actor(s) exploited what may be CVE-2025-61882 as a zero-day vulnerability against Oracle EBS customers as early as Aug. 9, 2025, weeks before a patch was available, with additional suspicious activity dating back to July 10, 2025.&quot;
Oracle had initially connected the attacks to older vulnerabilities disclosed and patched in July. However, the company disclosed earlier this month that the attacks on EBS instances stemmed from CVE-2025-61882.
Oracle has since released a new advisory on another vulnerability affecting EBS, tracked as CVE-2025-61884. The bug, disclosed on Oct. 11, affects versions 12.2.3 to 12.2.14 and is remotely exploitable without authentication. As it had with CVE-2025-61882, Oracle is again &quot;strongly&quot; recommending to its customers to apply the emergency update as soon as possible.

Oracle&#x27;s advisory does not specify if CVE-2025-61884 is currently being exploited in the wild against EBS customers, but several cybersecurity companies have urged organizations to prioritize mitigation of the flaw. &quot;Given historical targeting and the recent Cl0p ransomware activity, threat actors are likely to express interest and attempt exploitation in the near future,&quot; said Andres Ramos, senior threat intelligence researcher at Arctic Wolf, in a blog post .
In 2023, Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Progress Software&#x27;s MOVEit Transfer software in a broad attack campaign that impacted an estimated 2,000 organizations .

Breaking cybersecurity news, news analysis, commentary, and other content from around the world, with an initial focus on the Middle East &amp; Africa and the Asia Pacific
Africa Remains Top Global Target, Even as Attacks Decline Africa Remains Top Global Target, Even as Attacks Decline Africa Remains Top Global Target, Even as Attacks Decline
Organizations across the continent saw 10% fewer attacks in September, but Africa remains the most attacked region in the world, leading the Global South.
October 15, 2025
African organizations remained the top global targets of cyberattacks in September, suffering more than 3,000 attacks per week during the past two months, despite recent declines in cyberthreat detections.
The downward trend continued into early October and could be evidence that broad policy measures and increased law enforcement are impacting some cyberattackers&#x27; efforts, but there is also no reason to think the slight reduction in attacks will be sustained, says Omer Dembinsky, group manager at cybersecurity firm Check Point Research, which published the data.
&quot;There could be an impact on how much countries invest in nation-level cyber defense measures and regulations — as well as education to corporate employees on safe online behavior — helping reduce the amount of attacks that actually reach corporate networks in some regions and cause it to be higher in regions where this is less of a focus,&quot; he says.
Overall, Africa and the other regions of the Global South see about twice as many weekly cyberattacks compared to their peers in North America and Europe, according to Check Point&#x27;s data. In Africa, the eastern and western regions have seen cybercrime take off, accounting for about a third of all reported crimes, while nine in 10 African countries lack the legal and investigative skills to combat the increase, according to a June report from Interpol .

Much of the activity is driven by cybercriminal groups taking advantage of these less mature legal frameworks and growing Dark Web marketplaces, says Anna Yurtaeva, head of high-tech crime investigations for Middle East and Africa at Group-IB, a cybersecurity services firm based in Singapore.
&quot;The African region ranks among the highest globally in terms of compromised hosts and APT group activity, with a growing number of actors selling access to corporate networks on underground markets,&quot; she says. &quot;This demonstrates that Africa is not only a target of cyberattacks but is also emerging as one of the centers of global cybercriminal activity.&quot;
More Phishing, Less Ransomware
Because many nations in Africa are rapidly adopting digital technologies throughout their economies and have a high proportion of mobile users, the region has become an attractive target for cybercriminals who have used romance and investment scams, as well as compromised devices and information stealers, to profit from the lack of general security expertise. In August, Interpol arrested more than 1,200 suspected cybercriminals over a three-month collaboration with local law enforcement groups, including disbanding the group behind an investment scam that caused $300 million in losses.

Despite some recent wins, African nations have a perennial shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals while facing cyber-espionage attacks from state-sponsored groups. It&#x27;s no wonder that Africa has one of the highest numbers of compromised hosts in the world, Yurtaeva says.
&quot;These breaches often become just the starting point for bigger attacks — like data theft, extortion, or selling access to systems on the Dark Web,&quot; she says. &quot;This growing shadow economy provides the foundation for subsequent campaigns involving ransomware, phishing, and financial fraud.&quot;
For the most part, however, ransomware is less of a problem. African organizations report the fewest instances of ransomware, accounting for only 1% of the 562 ransomeware attacks reported in September, according to Check Point&#x27;s report . More than half of ransomware reports (54%) came from North America, while Europe and Asia made up another third of attacks — 19% and 12%, respectively.
Some research has suggested that ransomware gangs test drive their attacks in Africa , before widening the reach of their campaigns.
Rapid Security Development Needed
Related: Asian Orgs Shift Cybersecurity Requirements to Suppliers
African organizations are already improving their cybersecurity efforts, and that could be behind the recent decline in weekly attacks. However, there is more to do, says John Paul Onyango, Check Point&#x27;s country manager for East Africa.
&quot;For Africa to stay ahead of escalating cyber threats, organizations must embrace a prevention-first mindset — shifting from detection to proactive defense,&quot; he says. &quot;By uniting AI-driven protection, skilled cybersecurity talent, and regional collaboration, we can secure critical infrastructure, strengthen national resilience, and build a safer digital future for the continent.&quot;
In addition to implementing multifactor authentication, deploying managed detection-and-response (MDR) systems, conducting regular security audits, and providing ongoing staff training, companies need to cooperate with global partners, says Group-IB&#x27;s Yurtaeva.
&quot;Cooperation with national CERTs and global partners is crucial,&quot; he says. &quot;[M]any attacks in Africa originate from underground markets where access to corporate networks is sold, underscoring the need for active threat monitoring and proactive vulnerability remediation.&quot;

Africa Remains Top Global Target, Even as Attacks Decline Africa Remains Top Global Target, Even as Attacks Decline Africa Remains Top Global Target, Even as Attacks Decline
Organizations across the continent saw 10% fewer attacks in September, but Africa remains the most attacked region in the world, leading the Global South.
October 15, 2025
African organizations remained the top global targets of cyberattacks in September, suffering more than 3,000 attacks per week during the past two months, despite recent declines in cyberthreat detections.
The downward trend continued into early October and could be evidence that broad policy measures and increased law enforcement are impacting some cyberattackers&#x27; efforts, but there is also no reason to think the slight reduction in attacks will be sustained, says Omer Dembinsky, group manager at cybersecurity firm Check Point Research, which published the data.
&quot;There could be an impact on how much countries invest in nation-level cyber defense measures and regulations — as well as education to corporate employees on safe online behavior — helping reduce the amount of attacks that actually reach corporate networks in some regions and cause it to be higher in regions where this is less of a focus,&quot; he says.
Overall, Africa and the other regions of the Global South see about twice as many weekly cyberattacks compared to their peers in North America and Europe, according to Check Point&#x27;s data. In Africa, the eastern and western regions have seen cybercrime take off, accounting for about a third of all reported crimes, while nine in 10 African countries lack the legal and investigative skills to combat the increase, according to a June report from Interpol .

Much of the activity is driven by cybercriminal groups taking advantage of these less mature legal frameworks and growing Dark Web marketplaces, says Anna Yurtaeva, head of high-tech crime investigations for Middle East and Africa at Group-IB, a cybersecurity services firm based in Singapore.
&quot;The African region ranks among the highest globally in terms of compromised hosts and APT group activity, with a growing number of actors selling access to corporate networks on underground markets,&quot; she says. &quot;This demonstrates that Africa is not only a target of cyberattacks but is also emerging as one of the centers of global cybercriminal activity.&quot;
More Phishing, Less Ransomware
Because many nations in Africa are rapidly adopting digital technologies throughout their economies and have a high proportion of mobile users, the region has become an attractive target for cybercriminals who have used romance and investment scams, as well as compromised devices and information stealers, to profit from the lack of general security expertise. In August, Interpol arrested more than 1,200 suspected cybercriminals over a three-month collaboration with local law enforcement groups, including disbanding the group behind an investment scam that caused $300 million in losses.

Despite some recent wins, African nations have a perennial shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals while facing cyber-espionage attacks from state-sponsored groups. It&#x27;s no wonder that Africa has one of the highest numbers of compromised hosts in the world, Yurtaeva says.
&quot;These breaches often become just the starting point for bigger attacks — like data theft, extortion, or selling access to systems on the Dark Web,&quot; she says. &quot;This growing shadow economy provides the foundation for subsequent campaigns involving ransomware, phishing, and financial fraud.&quot;
For the most part, however, ransomware is less of a problem. African organizations report the fewest instances of ransomware, accounting for only 1% of the 562 ransomeware attacks reported in September, according to Check Point&#x27;s report . More than half of ransomware reports (54%) came from North America, while Europe and Asia made up another third of attacks — 19% and 12%, respectively.
Some research has suggested that ransomware gangs test drive their attacks in Africa , before widening the reach of their campaigns.
Rapid Security Development Needed

African organizations are already improving their cybersecurity efforts, and that could be behind the recent decline in weekly attacks. However, there is more to do, says John Paul Onyango, Check Point&#x27;s country manager for East Africa.
&quot;For Africa to stay ahead of escalating cyber threats, organizations must embrace a prevention-first mindset — shifting from detection to proactive defense,&quot; he says. &quot;By uniting AI-driven protection, skilled cybersecurity talent, and regional collaboration, we can secure critical infrastructure, strengthen national resilience, and build a safer digital future for the continent.&quot;
In addition to implementing multifactor authentication, deploying managed detection-and-response (MDR) systems, conducting regular security audits, and providing ongoing staff training, companies need to cooperate with global partners, says Group-IB&#x27;s Yurtaeva.
&quot;Cooperation with national CERTs and global partners is crucial,&quot; he says. &quot;[M]any attacks in Africa originate from underground markets where access to corporate networks is sold, underscoring the need for active threat monitoring and proactive vulnerability remediation.&quot;

Microsoft Drops Terrifyingly Large October Patch Update Microsoft Drops Terrifyingly Large October Patch Update Microsoft Drops Terrifyingly Large October Patch Update
October 2025&#x27;s enormous Patch Tuesday offers plenty of nightmares for admins, including actively exploited zero-days and insidious high-severity privilege-escalation bugs — and it spells curtains for Windows 10 updates.
October 14, 2025
Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday security update for October weighed in at a hefty 175 CVEs, including two that attackers are already exploiting, three that were previously disclosed, and more than a dozen in total that the company considers likely targets for exploitation.
It is the biggest Patch Tuesday update on record for Microsoft in recent memory, and pushes the number of unique vulnerabilities the company has released so far this year to more than all of the vulnerabilities recorded in 2024.
More Microsoft Vulnerabilities in October Than All of Last Year
&quot;With two months remaining this year, we’ve already blown last year’s tally of 1,009 CVEs patched, as this month’s release brings us up to 1,021,&quot; said Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, in a statement. The update is the largest since Tenable began documenting Microsoft patch releases in 2017, and doesn’t even include out-of-cycle patches that the company issued prior to Patch Tuesday, or those that do not list Microsoft as the issuer, he said.
As usual, the vulnerabilities that Microsoft disclosed this week affected a wide range of its products and included a mix of remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, elevation of privilege flaws , flaws that enable data theft, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and bypass of security features.
Related: Microsoft Issues Emergency Patch for Critical Windows Server Bug
Many of the vulnerabilities that Microsoft disclosed this week merit high-priority attention, but few more so that the two zero-days that attackers are already actively exploiting.
Zero-Day Threats Offer Privilege Escalation
One of the zero-days, CVE-2025-59230 (CVSS 7.8) in Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, allows attackers who already have access on an affected system to escalate privileges all the way to admin level. Mike Walters, president and co-founder of Action1, assessed that the flaw has to do with how the service — which manages VPN and remote access connections — processes commands from low-privileged users without proper authentication. &quot;Exploitation of this vulnerability is relatively easy, making it accessible even to attackers with moderate technical skills,&quot; he warned in prepared comments.
The other actively exploited zero-day, CVE-2025-24990 (CVSS 7.8), is also an EoP vulnerability, this time in a third-party driver for the Windows Agere modem. The driver ships natively with all supported versions of the Windows operating system. Attackers can exploit the flaw to gain system-level privileges on affected systems, even if the modem itself is not being actively used. Microsoft has removed the driver, meaning Agere modems that use the driver will no longer work on Windows. &quot;Microsoft recommends removing any existing dependencies on this hardware,&quot; the company said in its advisory.

In addition to the actively exploited zero-days, Microsoft also disclosed another, publicly disclosed flaw in the same Windows Agere modem service for which a proof-of-concept exploit (PoC) is already available. That zero-day bug, tracked as CVE-2025-24052 (CVSS 7.8) is also an EoP issue that enables attackers to gain system level privileges.
&quot;Even if the modem is not in use, it remains vulnerable to exploitation, which could give an attacker administrator privileges,&quot; Satnam from Tenable noted. &quot;The fix for this flaw is telling: Microsoft is removing the driver, ltmdm64.sys, from Windows operating systems through the October cumulative update.&quot;
Of note, Microsoft&#x27;s patch update also included a fix for yet another zero-day bug that attackers are actively exploiting, though technically, it&#x27;s not a Microsoft CVE. The bug, CVE-2025-47827 (CVSS 4.6) affects IGEL OS, a lightweight, Linux-based operating system for managing virtual desktops and cloud workspaces on endpoint devices. The vulnerability was disclosed in May, and it was MITRE that assigned the CVE number for the flaw, not Microsoft. The bug enables bypass of Secure Boot mechanisms. &quot;A PoC has been publicly available since this vulnerability was disclosed back in May, meaning it would be trivial for threat actors to weaponize this vulnerability,&quot; said Kev Breen, senior director threat research at Immersive in emailed comments.

High-Priority Windows Security Feature Bugs
Walters from Action1 identified CVE-2025-59287 (CVSS 9.8,) an RCE bug in the Windows Server Update Service, as an issue that security teams might want to prioritize. WSUS is the mechanism that organizations use to centrally distribute and manage updates and patches, and a successful exploit of a bug in the service could enable an attacker to create considerable damage. This might include &quot;complete compromise of the patching infrastructure, deployment of malicious &#x27;updates&#x27; to managed systems, lateral movement throughout the environment, and the creation of persistent backdoors in the update infrastructure,&quot; Walters said. Microsoft has tagged CVE-2025-59287 as a vulnerability that attackers are more likely to exploit.
CVE-2025-55315 (CVSS 9.9) is another security-feature bypass that Microsoft disclosed this week. The bug affects the ASP.Net Core framework and, if exploited, could have a high impact on system confidentiality, integrity, and availability, according to Microsoft. It gives attackers a way to view user credentials, change file contents on the target server, and even trigger a system crash. Though severe, &quot;it is important to note that this vulnerability is not exploitable by an anonymous attacker; it requires the threat actor to first be authenticated with valid, low-privilege user credentials,&quot; said Ben McCarthy, lead cyber security engineer at Immersive, in comments reacting to Microsoft&#x27;s patch release.
No Patches: Windows 10 End of Life Is Here
Significantly, this week&#x27;s patch update also marked the end of life for Windows 10, meaning that Microsoft will no longer issue regular patches for vulnerabilities in the operating system as part of its regular Patch Tuesday updates. The impact could be significant, given the OS still holds a nearly 41% share of the desktop Windows version market worldwide.
Organizations that are still on Windows 10 will need to switch to the Extended Security Updates program to continue receiving patches after today, said Nick Carroll, cyber incident response manager at Nightwing, in a statement. Other, less well-known products that also reached end of life this week include Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Skype for Business 2016, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise Version 22H2, and Outlook 2016. &quot;All these products and more will stop getting security patches,&quot; Carroll said, &quot;but that doesn&#x27;t mean the threat actors will stop making new exploits for them.&quot;

As usual, the vulnerabilities that Microsoft disclosed this week affected a wide range of its products and included a mix of remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, elevation of privilege flaws , flaws that enable data theft, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and bypass of security features.

Many of the vulnerabilities that Microsoft disclosed this week merit high-priority attention, but few more so that the two zero-days that attackers are already actively exploiting.
Zero-Day Threats Offer Privilege Escalation
One of the zero-days, CVE-2025-59230 (CVSS 7.8) in Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, allows attackers who already have access on an affected system to escalate privileges all the way to admin level. Mike Walters, president and co-founder of Action1, assessed that the flaw has to do with how the service — which manages VPN and remote access connections — processes commands from low-privileged users without proper authentication. &quot;Exploitation of this vulnerability is relatively easy, making it accessible even to attackers with moderate technical skills,&quot; he warned in prepared comments.
The other actively exploited zero-day, CVE-2025-24990 (CVSS 7.8), is also an EoP vulnerability, this time in a third-party driver for the Windows Agere modem. The driver ships natively with all supported versions of the Windows operating system. Attackers can exploit the flaw to gain system-level privileges on affected systems, even if the modem itself is not being actively used. Microsoft has removed the driver, meaning Agere modems that use the driver will no longer work on Windows. &quot;Microsoft recommends removing any existing dependencies on this hardware,&quot; the company said in its advisory.

In addition to the actively exploited zero-days, Microsoft also disclosed another, publicly disclosed flaw in the same Windows Agere modem service for which a proof-of-concept exploit (PoC) is already available. That zero-day bug, tracked as CVE-2025-24052 (CVSS 7.8) is also an EoP issue that enables attackers to gain system level privileges.
&quot;Even if the modem is not in use, it remains vulnerable to exploitation, which could give an attacker administrator privileges,&quot; Satnam from Tenable noted. &quot;The fix for this flaw is telling: Microsoft is removing the driver, ltmdm64.sys, from Windows operating systems through the October cumulative update.&quot;
Of note, Microsoft&#x27;s patch update also included a fix for yet another zero-day bug that attackers are actively exploiting, though technically, it&#x27;s not a Microsoft CVE. The bug, CVE-2025-47827 (CVSS 4.6) affects IGEL OS, a lightweight, Linux-based operating system for managing virtual desktops and cloud workspaces on endpoint devices. The vulnerability was disclosed in May, and it was MITRE that assigned the CVE number for the flaw, not Microsoft. The bug enables bypass of Secure Boot mechanisms. &quot;A PoC has been publicly available since this vulnerability was disclosed back in May, meaning it would be trivial for threat actors to weaponize this vulnerability,&quot; said Kev Breen, senior director threat research at Immersive in emailed comments.

High-Priority Windows Security Feature Bugs
Walters from Action1 identified CVE-2025-59287 (CVSS 9.8,) an RCE bug in the Windows Server Update Service, as an issue that security teams might want to prioritize. WSUS is the mechanism that organizations use to centrally distribute and manage updates and patches, and a successful exploit of a bug in the service could enable an attacker to create considerable damage. This might include &quot;complete compromise of the patching infrastructure, deployment of malicious &#x27;updates&#x27; to managed systems, lateral movement throughout the environment, and the creation of persistent backdoors in the update infrastructure,&quot; Walters said. Microsoft has tagged CVE-2025-59287 as a vulnerability that attackers are more likely to exploit.
CVE-2025-55315 (CVSS 9.9) is another security-feature bypass that Microsoft disclosed this week. The bug affects the ASP.Net Core framework and, if exploited, could have a high impact on system confidentiality, integrity, and availability, according to Microsoft. It gives attackers a way to view user credentials, change file contents on the target server, and even trigger a system crash. Though severe, &quot;it is important to note that this vulnerability is not exploitable by an anonymous attacker; it requires the threat actor to first be authenticated with valid, low-privilege user credentials,&quot; said Ben McCarthy, lead cyber security engineer at Immersive, in comments reacting to Microsoft&#x27;s patch release.
No Patches: Windows 10 End of Life Is Here
Significantly, this week&#x27;s patch update also marked the end of life for Windows 10, meaning that Microsoft will no longer issue regular patches for vulnerabilities in the operating system as part of its regular Patch Tuesday updates. The impact could be significant, given the OS still holds a nearly 41% share of the desktop Windows version market worldwide.
Organizations that are still on Windows 10 will need to switch to the Extended Security Updates program to continue receiving patches after today, said Nick Carroll, cyber incident response manager at Nightwing, in a statement. Other, less well-known products that also reached end of life this week include Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Skype for Business 2016, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise Version 22H2, and Outlook 2016. &quot;All these products and more will stop getting security patches,&quot; Carroll said, &quot;but that doesn&#x27;t mean the threat actors will stop making new exploits for them.&quot;

China&#x27;s Flax Typhoon Turns Geo-Mapping Server into a Backdoor China&#x27;s Flax Typhoon Turns Geo-Mapping Server into a Backdoor China&#x27;s Flax Typhoon Turns Geo-Mapping Server into a Backdoor
Chinese APT threat actors compromised an organization&#x27;s ArcGIS server, modifying the widely used geospatial mapping software for stealth access.
October 14, 2025
Researchers discovered a &quot;wakeup call&quot; type of attack by a Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group that established backdoor access to an organization for more than a year through a geospatial mapping application.
In a blog post from cybersecurity vendor Reliaquest, researchers detailed how a notorious threat group tracked as Flax Typhoon constructed &quot;an unusually clever attack chain&quot; that manipulated a component of ArcGIS, a widely known geo-mapping platform from software maker Esri. The researchers found Flax Typhoon actors compromised an organization&#x27;s public-facing ArcGIS server and used the access to turn a trusted application into a backdoor .
&quot;This attack is a wakeup call: Any entry point with backend access must be treated as a top-tier priority, no matter how routine or trusted,&quot; Reliaquest analysts Alexa Feminella and James Xiang wrote in the blog post .
Turning ArcGIS into a Web Shell
Reliaquest investigated a potential compromise of an ArcGIS customer, and after ruling out that a zero-day vulnerability or misconfiguration were involved, researchers uncovered a unique attack that demonstrated Flax Typhoon&#x27;s sophistication and creativity.
The researchers found the threat actors established year-long access to the organization by modifying ArcGIS&#x27; Java server object extension (SOE), which allows users to create service operations for maps and images, and turning the component into a Web shell . Flex Typhoon accomplished this by compromising a portal administrator account for ArcGIS, the researchers explained.

&quot;The attackers found a public-facing ArcGIS server that was connected to a private, internal ArcGIS server for backend computations (a common default configuration),&quot; Feminella and Xiang wrote.
According to ArcGIS documentation, the public portal serves as a proxy, forwarding commands to the internal server through a Web adapter. The attackers sent disguised commands to the portal server, which created a hidden system directory in the server that essentially became Flax Typhoon&#x27;s private workspace, the researchers said, complete with a hardcoded key.
Additionally, Flax Typhoon&#x27;s attack chain ensured the malicious SOE would remain in place even after a full system recovery. &quot;The group&#x27;s persistence method was even more insidious. By ensuring the compromised component was included in system backups, they turned the organization&#x27;s own recovery plan into a guaranteed method of reinfection,&quot; Feminella and Xiang wrote.
Mitigating Flax Typhoon Threats
Reliaquest said it worked with the customer organization and Esri to fully evict Flax Typhoon actors from the environment, which included rebuilding the entire server stack and deploying custom detections for the threat activity.
Related: Self-Propagating GlassWorm Attacks VS Code Supply Chain
ArcGIS attack follows other notable threat activity targeting geo-mapping software; last month, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) disclosed that a large, unnamed federal civilian executive branch agency was breached in 2024 through a vulnerability in GeoServer, an open source geospatial data server.
An Esri spokesperson tells Dark Reading that the company has not seen any evidence or received reports indicating that other organizations have been impacted by this type of attack.
Reliaquest also said it has seen no evidence of other organizations that have been breached by malicious ArcGIS SOE. &quot;However, the report&#x27;s main warning is that while the component was specific to ArcGIS, the tactic is not,&quot; a company spokesperson said. &quot;While the method of persistence is unique, this can happen to any publicly facing application where security best practices are assumed but not enforced. Therefore, it is highly likely that many organizations are vulnerable to this same attack chain, using the creative modification of any legitimate component.&quot;
Related: AI Chat Data Is History&#x27;s Most Thorough Record of Enterprise Secrets. Secure It Wisely
Reliaquest urged organizations to treat all public-facing applications as high-risk assets. To that end, the researchers recommended security teams audit and harden such applications, no matter how routine. Feminella and Xiang also highlighted the fact that Flax Typhoon didn&#x27;t use any malware or known malicious files, which emphasizes the need for behavioral analytics to complement signature-based detection.
The researchers also stressed the importance of strong credential hygiene, noting that &quot;a weak administrator password&quot; gave the attackers a foothold in the organization&#x27;s network. In addition to enforcing strong, unique passwords, Reliaquest recommended implementing multifactor authentication and practicing the principal of least privilege.

Pixnapping Attack Lets Attackers Steal 2FA on Android Pixnapping Attack Lets Attackers Steal 2FA on Android Pixnapping Attack Lets Attackers Steal 2FA on Android
The proof-of-concept exploit allows an attacker to steal sensitive data from Gmail, Google Accounts, Google Authenticator, Google Maps, Signal, and Venmo.
October 14, 2025
A new Android-focused proof-of-concept exploit would enable threat actors to steal secrets like multifactor authentication credentials from certain Android devices.
The attack, named &quot;pixnapping,&quot; was created by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Washington; the University of California, San Diego; and Carnegie Mellon University. The team described it on a dedicated research website as a &quot;new class of attacks that allows a malicious Android app to stealthily leak information displayed by other Android apps or arbitrary websites.&quot;
Researchers demonstrated the attack on Google and Samsung phones and have managed &quot;end-to-end recovery of sensitive data from websites including Gmail and Google Accounts and apps including Signal, Google Authenticator, Venmo, and Google Maps.&quot;
&quot;Notably, our attack against Google Authenticator allows any malicious app to steal 2FA codes in under 30 seconds while hiding the attack from the user,&quot; the pixnapping research website read .
Although there has been no indication that attackers have successfully exploited the proof-of-concept (POC) to date, no definitive patch appears to be available on any Android device.
How Pixnapping Works
Although the attack was tested on Google and Samsung devices for the sake of the study (including Google Pixel 6, 7, 8 and 9, and Samsung Galaxy S25), researchers said pixnapping, which targets Android APIs and a hardware side channel, actually affects nearly all modern Android devices.

Pixnapping exists among a larger, older genre of attack known as &quot;pixel stealing,&quot; where a source can determine how a pixel (typically from some other source) is displayed to a user through some kind of side channel.
In this case, malicious code is installed on an app that is opened by the user. Anything that is visible to the user while the app is opened, such as in another application tab, can be stolen including two-factor authentication codes, email, chat messages, and other secrets.
&quot;Our key observation is that Android APIs enable an attacker to create an analog to Stone-style attacks outside of the browser. Specifically, a malicious app can force victim pixels into the rendering pipeline via Android intents and compute on those victim pixels using a stack of semi-transparent Android activities,&quot; a white paper presenting the research read. A &quot;Stone-style attack&quot; refers to researcher Paul Stone, who originated the pixel-stealing attack concept in 2013. &quot;Crucially, our framework enables stealing secrets only stored locally (e.g., 2FA codes and Google Maps Timeline), which have never before been in reach of pixel stealing attacks,&quot; the researchers added.

Secrets that aren&#x27;t displayed on screen, even if stored in the device, cannot be captured by the malicious code.
Researchers were able to capture pixels across Android activities by using multiple APIs, including one dedicated to window blurring and another for VSync callbacks.
Why Pixnapping Matters
The attack has been designated CVE-2025-48561. The team behind the POC said no vendor has conclusively mitigated the attack to date. As the pixnapping researchers explained, Google released a patch in early September but researchers found a subsequent workaround.
In a statement, a Google spokesperson tells Dark Reading that the company&#x27;s September patch partially mitigates pixnapping, but adds, &quot;We are issuing an additional patch for this vulnerability in the December Android security bulletin.&quot; Google has not observed any evidence of in-the-wild exploitation.
In an email, Google adds that exploiting the vulnerability requires specific data about the target device and that malicious applications exploiting the vulnerability have not yet been found on Google Play.
Pixnapping does not, on its face, appear to be the kind of side-channel attack that changes how threat actors target Android devices —exploitation appears to be somewhat complicated and requires an open application. But pixnapping is another option for the Android attacker&#x27;s toolkit and another possible way to harvest data through a theoretical social engineering campaign.

For users, pixnapping researchers recommend staying up to date on Android security updates. For app developers, advice was less clear. &quot;We are not aware of mitigation strategies to protect apps against pixnapping. If you have any insights into mitigations, please let us know and we will update this section,&quot; the pixnapping site read.

Financial, Other Industries Urged to Prepare for Quantum Computers Financial, Other Industries Urged to Prepare for Quantum Computers Financial, Other Industries Urged to Prepare for Quantum Computers
Despite daunting technical challenges, a quantum computer capable of breaking public-key encryption systems may be only a decade or two off.
October 13, 2025
Financial firms, government agencies, and other sectors with sensitive data need to worry about the arrival of quantum computers today, even though a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) may be decades away, experts warn.
In late September, the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) said that crypto-procrastination is resulting in financial firms being unprepared for the future threats and data risks posed by quantum computers. A variety of factors — from interdependencies between firms to the need to support standards — have slowed planning and hampered adoption of post-quantum encryption.
Yet companies need to deal with the risk today because sensitive data can be harvested and stored to be decrypted in the future, says Mike Silverman, chief strategy and innovation officer at FS-ISAC.
&quot;Regardless of when this happens, no cryptography is secure forever, and we won&#x27;t always be able to depend on the algorithms we&#x27;re using today,&quot; he says. &quot;Good risk management practices require us to become cryptographically agile — the ability to change algorithms efficiently to respond quickly to the business and threat environment.&quot;
Along with the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing is considered one of the most serious future security risks. Most experts give a better-than-even chance that in 20 years quantum computers will be able to break data encrypted by the RSA-2048 public-key cryptosystem in 24 hours . In August, an alliance of four companies — IBM Consulting, Keyfactor, Quantinuum, and Thales — pooled their resources to help develop assessment and migration capabilities .

An Uncertain Timeline
Increased investment into quantum-computing research and a number of significant milestones have led to predictions that a CRQC is a decade or two away. In May, for example, Google researchers estimated that they could factor a 2048-bit RSA key using 1 million qubits , down from a previous estimate of 20 million qubits. The current state of the art is a 6,100-qubit processor developed by the California Institute of Technology .
&quot;There&#x27;s still work to be done, but there seems to be a very real sense that it is inevitable and will happen sooner than anticipated,&quot; says Rebecca Krauthamer, CEO and co-founder of QuSecure, a quantum-security-as-a-service firm. &quot;It&#x27;s worth remembering that a lot of this research also is highly classified, so we may not know of many advancements.&quot;
When research reaches certain critical points, progress accelerates rapidly, says Daniel dos Santos, senior director and head of research at Forescout Technologies, a managed security firm.

&quot;Think of the progress of AI — the discipline has been around for more than 50 years, but the results in the past five years have surprised everyone,&quot; he says. &quot;We could reach an &#x27;AI moment&#x27; for quantum computing in the next few years that could greatly accelerate timelines by bringing in more investment, people, and resources to the field.&quot;
X + Y = Oh No!
The FS-ISAC paper points to calculation, known as Mosca&#x27;s Theorem, that highlights the need to prepare for quantum computers decades before they become a viable way to decrypt old data.
The theorem says that the length of time that data is required to be secure (X) plus the time it takes to upgrade encryption systems (Y) needs to happen before the arrival of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer. This is because threat actors — especially nation-states — are likely hoarding sensitive data from rivals and adversaries in preparation of being able to decrypt it in the future, a strategy known as &quot;harvest now, decrypt later” (HNDL).
If the time needed for data to be secure plus the time to migrate infrastructure to QC-resistant encryption extends beyond the arrival of a quantum computer, companies could lose sensitive data. Source: FS-ISAC
The timeline means that, even if a quantum computer is decades away, the threat is still pressing, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) stated in a report published late last year. Organizations must begin migrating to post-quantum cryptography now to avoid having their encrypted data exposed when the computers become operational, NIST wrote.
Related: New Quantum-Safe Alliance Aims to Accelerate PQC Implementation
&quot;This threat ... underscores the necessity of acting immediately, especially for data with long-term sensitivity, such as government secrets or medical records,&quot; the report concluded.
While some organizations in critical sectors such as finance and government have started to inventory their assets, most businesses are not even thinking about the threat posed by quantum computers, says Forescout&#x27;s dos Santos.
&quot;Although five years might sound like a long time to migrate, we know there are assets out there still running decades-old software,&quot; he says, including Windows 10, Windows 2000, and even Windows XP.
Crypto-Procrastination
A major problem for businesses and governments is that preparing for quantum computers requires planning for an event a decade or more in the future, while budgetary uncertainty is a more present issue. Moving to entirely new encryption mechanisms and making the replacement of old encryption algorithms more efficient requires a great deal of effort for a threat that many organizations do not find pressing.
The EU has set a deadline for critical-infrastructure firms to start their post-quantum encryption transition by 2026 and to finish in 2030. Less critical systems have until 2035. Canada has set the deadline for a draft PQC transition plan for April 2026 for government agencies, with high-priority systems fully transitioned by the end of 2031. In the US, NIST plans to transition away from vulnerable encryption algorithms by 2030 and completely disallow them in 2035.
Organizations need to start creating a focused transition program, says FS-ISAC&#x27;s Silverman. By inventorying apps, protocols, hardware modules, and third-party services, staff can build a crypto-dependency map to plan transitions in different infrastructures. High- and medium-risk use cases should be identified and prioritized, until the organization is confident it can eliminate all quantum-vulnerable algorithms, he says.
&quot;Due to the interdependencies across the financial system, it’s essential that the entire sector collaborates on this transition,&quot; he says.
Overall, the solutions are here, says QuSecure&#x27;s Krauthamer.

&quot;Think of the progress of AI — the discipline has been around for more than 50 years, but the results in the past five years have surprised everyone,&quot; he says. &quot;We could reach an &#x27;AI moment&#x27; for quantum computing in the next few years that could greatly accelerate timelines by bringing in more investment, people, and resources to the field.&quot;
X + Y = Oh No!
The FS-ISAC paper points to calculation, known as Mosca&#x27;s Theorem, that highlights the need to prepare for quantum computers decades before they become a viable way to decrypt old data.
The theorem says that the length of time that data is required to be secure (X) plus the time it takes to upgrade encryption systems (Y) needs to happen before the arrival of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer. This is because threat actors — especially nation-states — are likely hoarding sensitive data from rivals and adversaries in preparation of being able to decrypt it in the future, a strategy known as &quot;harvest now, decrypt later” (HNDL).
If the time needed for data to be secure plus the time to migrate infrastructure to QC-resistant encryption extends beyond the arrival of a quantum computer, companies could lose sensitive data. Source: FS-ISAC
The timeline means that, even if a quantum computer is decades away, the threat is still pressing, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) stated in a report published late last year. Organizations must begin migrating to post-quantum cryptography now to avoid having their encrypted data exposed when the computers become operational, NIST wrote.

&quot;This threat ... underscores the necessity of acting immediately, especially for data with long-term sensitivity, such as government secrets or medical records,&quot; the report concluded.
While some organizations in critical sectors such as finance and government have started to inventory their assets, most businesses are not even thinking about the threat posed by quantum computers, says Forescout&#x27;s dos Santos.
&quot;Although five years might sound like a long time to migrate, we know there are assets out there still running decades-old software,&quot; he says, including Windows 10, Windows 2000, and even Windows XP.
Crypto-Procrastination
A major problem for businesses and governments is that preparing for quantum computers requires planning for an event a decade or more in the future, while budgetary uncertainty is a more present issue. Moving to entirely new encryption mechanisms and making the replacement of old encryption algorithms more efficient requires a great deal of effort for a threat that many organizations do not find pressing.
The EU has set a deadline for critical-infrastructure firms to start their post-quantum encryption transition by 2026 and to finish in 2030. Less critical systems have until 2035. Canada has set the deadline for a draft PQC transition plan for April 2026 for government agencies, with high-priority systems fully transitioned by the end of 2031. In the US, NIST plans to transition away from vulnerable encryption algorithms by 2030 and completely disallow them in 2035.
Organizations need to start creating a focused transition program, says FS-ISAC&#x27;s Silverman. By inventorying apps, protocols, hardware modules, and third-party services, staff can build a crypto-dependency map to plan transitions in different infrastructures. High- and medium-risk use cases should be identified and prioritized, until the organization is confident it can eliminate all quantum-vulnerable algorithms, he says.
&quot;Due to the interdependencies across the financial system, it’s essential that the entire sector collaborates on this transition,&quot; he says.
Overall, the solutions are here, says QuSecure&#x27;s Krauthamer.

Critical infrastructure CISOs Can&#x27;t Ignore &#x27;Back-Office Clutter&#x27; Data Critical infrastructure CISOs Can&#x27;t Ignore &#x27;Back-Office Clutter&#x27; Data Critical infrastructure CISOs Can&#x27;t Ignore &#x27;Back-Office Clutter&#x27; Data
OT and ICS systems indeed hold the crown jewels of critical infrastructure organizations, but unmonitored data sprawl is proving to be pure gold for increasingly brazen nation-state threat actors like Volt Typhoon, Pearce argues.
October 13, 2025
OPINION
Security leaders in critical infrastructure traditionally have focused their defensive energy on operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS). Those remain the crown jewels for attackers. But while they&#x27;ve been patching programmable logic centers (PLCs) and segmenting control centers, sprawling collaboration platforms — SharePoint, Google Drive, Exchange, Gmail, Teams, Slack, Box, and old-fashioned file shares — have quietly become the single largest unmonitored attack surface in the enterprise.
These systems are indispensable. They&#x27;re easy to use, embedded into daily operations, and frictionless for sharing. That same ubiquity is exactly what makes them so dangerous. Information moves with a click, but oversight rarely keeps pace. Sensitive documents proliferate in dozens of formats, from CAD files to PDFs, and in hidden corners like document metadata and chat transcripts. Left ungoverned, these platforms are beyond messy; they&#x27;re opportunities waiting to be exploited.
Think about how collaboration works today in a utility or pipeline operator. Teams spin up SharePoint sites and Microsoft Teams or Slack channels without a second thought. Someone creates a Box folder for a vendor. HR moves onboarding forms to Google Drive. The result: petabytes of enterprise data sprawled across thousands of sites and folders, with little classification and even less monitoring.

Campaigns like Volt Typhoon have already demonstrated a preference for living off the land, with attackers exploiting the same tools employees rely on. SharePoint and Teams are irresistible: sprawling, under-governed, and full of the details an adversary needs to map your environment.
Consider a utility, serving 15 million customers. What&#x27;s in its collaboration stack?
Engineering and operations : CAD drawings, as-builts, substation layouts, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) runbooks
GIS and mapping : detailed asset maps, parcel data, feeder diagrams
Customer PII and meter data : billing, call center transcripts, smart meter records
HR and employee PII : payroll, benefits, recruiting files
Finance and legal : invoices, contracts, litigation documents
Regulatory evidence : NERC/FERC/CIP filings, SOX documentation, audit trails
Security and IT : IAM exports, network diagrams, privileged access notes

Risks Critical Infrastructure CISOs Should Fear Most
Several common issues emerge across critical infrastructure:
External exposure via oversharing : stale guest access or public links that never expire
OT and SCADA data in general-purpose sites : organizations placing system diagrams in the same library as their lunch-and-learn slides
Regulatory sprawl : audit evidence scattered across hundreds of sites, undermining defensibility
Secrets in documents : passwords, tokens, and keys sitting in spreadsheets or ticket exports
Bulk exfiltration potential : synchronization tools make it trivial to pull down massive datasets unnoticed
Each of these is a pathway for nation-state actors or sophisticated ransomware crews to quietly pivot toward disruption. And now, those risks are being supercharged by generative and agentic AI. These tools can accelerate reconnaissance, automate the mining of unstructured documents and metadata, and even chain together actions across platforms at a speed and scale defenders can&#x27;t match. In effect, AI turns sprawling collaboration ecosystems into low-hanging fruit for adversaries who know how to weaponize it.
Critical infrastructure operators can no longer afford to treat data sprawl as mere back-office clutter. In an era of persistent nation-state campaigns, sprawling SharePoint sites and unmanaged Teams channels represent a frontline security risk. OT segmentation and zero trust won&#x27;t matter if attackers can simply walk through your document libraries and chat logs.

Generation AI: Why Today&#x27;s Tech Graduates Are At a Disadvantage Generation AI: Why Today&#x27;s Tech Graduates Are At a Disadvantage Generation AI: Why Today&#x27;s Tech Graduates Are At a Disadvantage
With artificial intelligence supplanting entry-level security jobs, new cyber professionals will have to up their game to stay competitive in the industry.
October 13, 2025
Entry-level workers from the ages of 22-25 may be finding themselves fresh out of a job these days as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate industries across the world.
This is according to a recent study published by Stanford University, which found that jobs for this age demographic have declined by roughly 13% since the widespread adoption of generative AI (GenAI). And these changes are occurring in jobs most exposed to AI, such as software developers and computer programmers.
One explanation for the findings, according to the researchers, is that AI can replace young workers who are still gaining skills in their respective industries, raising questions as to what these entry-level professionals, particularly those in software, cybersecurity, and technology, should do to gain the skills they need to progress in their careers.
CISOs&#x27; Perspective on AI
Though concerns of AI replacing entry-level technology jobs continue to grow, some feel that AI won’t be as big of an issue compared to other technologies.
&quot;I think the concern about AI tooling possibly replacing entry-level roles should be a little bit less of a concern when it comes to security roles than other basic developer roles,&quot; says Marshall Erwin, chief information security officer (CISO) at Fastly . &quot;The basic reason for that is, even putting aside your sort of new AI trends, any security team is really struggling with volume.&quot;
Related: How CISA Layoffs Weaken Civilian Cyber Defense
He adds that with the challenges cybersecurity professionals face every day, companies can&#x27;t just &quot;hire their way out of that problem.&quot; To Erwin, adding automations into daily processes allows organizations to filter through the noise so that real, human professionals can focus on high-risk problems when they&#x27;re needed.

Jason Manar, CISO at Kaseya , agrees, noting that while change is inevitable, there will still be employment available for those willing to adapt.
&quot;There will be new opportunities, and you see this now with various engineering positions where there are more positions for generative AI and new positions within engineering,&quot; he says. &quot;So, is there consolidation that may take place with entry or junior level jobs? Yes, absolutely. Will there still be some type of junior job or entry level job? There will. I just think that&#x27;s going to be redefined as to what that is.&quot;

But according to Jessica Sica, CISO at Weave Communications , when reflecting on her personal experience while hiring entry-level professionals, the field is already getting increasingly harder to break into, and this may be regardless of AI&#x27;s influence.
&quot;Everybody says the security industry is growing rapidly, but it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to get in,&quot; she says. &quot;And I think part of that is maybe more and more people want to get into security, but the entry level jobs I think are getting more difficult. Companies are getting more demanding.&quot;
She adds that AI is only going to make it even more difficult to get into the field, particularly with entry-level jobs.
&quot;I think some of those tasks are going to be replaced with AI,&quot; she notes. &quot;Not sure that we&#x27;re there yet, but when that happens, how do you get in and how do you move up if those entry-level jobs are getting harder to find?&quot;
AI Raises the Bar for Entry-Level Tech Careers
Mudit Sinha, AI lead at Lineaje, is familiar with these concerns of how AI may affect employment. He graduated just two years ago with a bachelor of Science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Sinha landed his first job through networking — specifically, reaching out to the chief technology officer (CTO) of the company.

&quot;I was looking more into data analytics and a mix of AI back in the day, and the company had just started doing AI,&quot; he says. &quot;I did about three to four rounds of interviews, most of them with the CTO, the one with the CEO.&quot;
This is exactly what Sinha recommends to fresh graduates or individuals looking for entry-level positions in the field — reaching out, introducing yourself, and showcasing a project that the company might be interested in.

As for how AI will reshape the cybersecurity industry Sinha describes as &quot;growing,&quot; he believes that the tool will only enhance the field.
&quot;Everyone is expected to perform at a level higher than they previously were expected to perform,&quot; Sinha says. &quot;Juniors are now expected to do the same output as, let&#x27;s say, senior SDEs (software development engineer) or senior researchers because they have access to this really powerful tool. So, entry level people should not have the expectation that they are going to be treated as entry level applicants.&quot;
While this may be a hard pill to swallow, Sinha advises entry-level applicants to accept the challenge , prepare to understand the latest advancements in AI, maintain a genuine interest in cybersecurity, and not underestimate the value of soft-skills in this industry.
&quot;Ultimately people like interacting with other people, and that interaction piece is not really going away with AI, as far as I&#x27;ve seen,&quot; Sinha adds. &quot;Be sociable, be open to opportunities, and if you have the opportunity, keep talking to upper management or whoever you can.&quot;

Generation AI: Why Today&#x27;s Tech Graduates Are At a Disadvantage Generation AI: Why Today&#x27;s Tech Graduates Are At a Disadvantage Generation AI: Why Today&#x27;s Tech Graduates Are At a Disadvantage
With artificial intelligence supplanting entry-level security jobs, new cyber professionals will have to up their game to stay competitive in the industry.
October 13, 2025
Entry-level workers from the ages of 22-25 may be finding themselves fresh out of a job these days as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate industries across the world.
This is according to a recent study published by Stanford University, which found that jobs for this age demographic have declined by roughly 13% since the widespread adoption of generative AI (GenAI). And these changes are occurring in jobs most exposed to AI, such as software developers and computer programmers.
One explanation for the findings, according to the researchers, is that AI can replace young workers who are still gaining skills in their respective industries, raising questions as to what these entry-level professionals, particularly those in software, cybersecurity, and technology, should do to gain the skills they need to progress in their careers.
CISOs&#x27; Perspective on AI
Though concerns of AI replacing entry-level technology jobs continue to grow, some feel that AI won’t be as big of an issue compared to other technologies.
&quot;I think the concern about AI tooling possibly replacing entry-level roles should be a little bit less of a concern when it comes to security roles than other basic developer roles,&quot; says Marshall Erwin, chief information security officer (CISO) at Fastly . &quot;The basic reason for that is, even putting aside your sort of new AI trends, any security team is really struggling with volume.&quot;

He adds that with the challenges cybersecurity professionals face every day, companies can&#x27;t just &quot;hire their way out of that problem.&quot; To Erwin, adding automations into daily processes allows organizations to filter through the noise so that real, human professionals can focus on high-risk problems when they&#x27;re needed.
&quot;I think AI is really going to be helpful in that respect,&quot; he says. &quot;We need better ways to filter through that noise and manage the volume of what we&#x27;re seeing on a day-to-day basis and that&#x27;s a problem we&#x27;ve had for a long time, and these tools are going to help us with that.&quot;
Jason Manar, CISO at Kaseya , agrees, noting that while change is inevitable, there will still be employment available for those willing to adapt.
&quot;There will be new opportunities, and you see this now with various engineering positions where there are more positions for generative AI and new positions within engineering,&quot; he says. &quot;So, is there consolidation that may take place with entry or junior level jobs? Yes, absolutely. Will there still be some type of junior job or entry level job? There will. I just think that&#x27;s going to be redefined as to what that is.&quot;

1Password Addresses Critical AI Browser Agent Security Gap 1Password Addresses Critical AI Browser Agent Security Gap 1Password Addresses Critical AI Browser Agent Security Gap
The security company looks to tackle new authentication challenges that could lead to credential leakage, as enterprises increasingly leverage AI browser agents.
October 10, 2025
The growth of agentic browsers, which use artificial intelligence agents to perform tasks automatically, is causing new security challenges by creating the potential for credential compromise. To address that concern, 1Password has unveiled a new integration that lets users authenticate their identity without exposing their credentials.
While AI browser agents are helpful, they also pose significant authentication security risks. Browser agents may have the same privileges as users, but they are not as aware, which leaves them extra vulnerable to attacks. Agents store credentials and secrets in browser session storage or cookies that are often unencrypted. And the problem deserves attention because attackers have noticed that enterprises conduct more work in the browser.
1Password partnered with Browserbase to launch a new capability, dubbed Secure Agentic Autofill. This feature aims to enable agents to authenticate in the browser without exposing credentials, while keeping a human in the loop.
Security Shortcuts Pose Risks
Secure Agentic Autofill looks to solve visibility, control, and governance concerns over how AI agents access systems in the enterprise environment, said Nancy Wang, SVP of engineering at 1Password.
Users are increasingly integrating AI  agents into the browser to automate tasks like filling out tedious forms, ordering groceries, scheduling an appointment, or booking travel. Additionally, a new generation of agentic browsers—such as Perplexity’s Comet, Opera Neon and the new “reimagined with AI” version of Google—are integrating AI assistants to carry out tasks beyond organizing search results.

Using large language models (LLM), agents can navigate the web without any human interaction, but if the task requires login credentials, that means these agents gain access to highly sensitive information. Developers will hardcode secrets directly into code or prompts or store them in unsecured browser sessions to keep agents running smoothly, but those shortcuts pose risks to enterprises, which often lack visibility into what the agents are accessing.
Fixing AI Blind Spots
Secure Agentic Autofill works to eliminate the risk by keeping credentials out of the AI or LLM context. The integration was developed to address security blind spots in the way agents authenticate today, which prioritizes convenience over security .
With so much work done in the browser, navigating different sites and workflows, it&#x27;s difficult to remember all the passwords required. Users will provide secrets directly into AI-powered browsers, to avoid interruptions caused by agentic browsers waiting for humans to input credentials.
Related: NIST Digital Identity Guidelines Evolve With Threat Landscape
Though that may reduce user friction, it also exposes credentials to the agent and underlying LLM, increasing the chances of credential theft and leakage, Wang explains.
&quot;With 1Password&#x27;s zero-knowledge security model, credentials are delivered just-in-time through an end-to-end encrypted channel and autofilled through the 1Password browser extension after the request is human-approved,&quot; Wang says.
Part of the challenge posed by agents is that traditional identity security has not caught up to the AI boom. Authentication systems weren&#x27;t built for non-human identities acting in the browser; that&#x27;s why teams hardcode or share credentials in risky ways, warns Wang.
&quot;As AI agents take on more workflows, these authentication blind spots become a compliance and governance risk,&quot; Wang says.
Remaining Concerns
While it is a good idea to create another layer of protection, especially when handing off access to any tool, it could cause friction or limit the power of the agentic browser, says Pieter Arntz, malware intelligence researcher at Malwarebytes. These issues could lead to people misusing the technology, he adds.

&quot;My biggest concern with this sort of integration right now is the ease in which cybercriminals are able to trick agentic browsers with prompt injection,&quot; Arntz tells Dark Reading. &quot;If criminals could lure agentic browsers to a site and extract important passwords from it through prompt injection, then the ramifications could be terrible.&quot;

RondoDox Botnet: an &#x27;Exploit Shotgun&#x27; for Edge Vulns RondoDox Botnet: an &#x27;Exploit Shotgun&#x27; for Edge Vulns RondoDox Botnet: an &#x27;Exploit Shotgun&#x27; for Edge Vulns
RondoDox takes a hit-and-run, shotgun approach to exploiting bugs in consumer edge devices around the world.
October 10, 2025
A new botnet is exploiting dozens of known vulnerabilities in hard-to-patch edge devices.
&quot; RondoDox &quot; is characteristically unlike most botnets , researchers from Trend Micro said in a report on Thursday. Where others are specially crafted to pick apart select vulnerabilities like a surgeon, RondoDox blasts onto infected devices like Rambo, trying exploit after exploit to see which one sticks.
It&#x27;s boorish but effective, largely because the types of devices it aims at are typically unmonitored, unmanaged, and utterly for the taking.
The Exploit Shotgun
RondoDox started making the rounds in May, according to Trend Micro. At first, it was exploiting one critical and one high-severity n-day vulnerability in relatively popular digital video recorders (DVR) and routers, respectively.
Over the summer, the botnet expanded massively. It now doubles as a loader for the Mirai and Morte Internet-of-Things (IoT) malware families. And it can exploit any one of 56 vulnerabilities in a variety of routers, DVRs, network video recorders (NVRs), Web servers, CCTV systems, and other kinds of networking devices globally. Fifty of those 56 are command injection flaws , allowing for leisurely device manipulation.
The key to how RondoDox manages so many vulnerabilities at once is twofold. For one thing, all 56 are publicly known — 38 enough to have warranted Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers. Plus, the malware doesn&#x27;t spend resources specially customizing each and every infection. Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness for the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) at Trend Micro, explains that &quot;it&#x27;s more just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks. It has its toolbox that it uses, but it&#x27;s kind of blasting everything that it has at once.&quot;

RondoDox&#x27;s spread has been as unfocused and opportunistic as its tactics would suggest, reaching across wide geographic regions without bias. The scale of its impact isn&#x27;t known yet, but Childs suggests that with all evidence considered, &quot;it&#x27;s potentially quite large.&quot;
Why Consumer Device Bugs Go Unfixed
If RondoDox were to try its shotgun approach on corporate devices, or even personal computers, it would almost certainly run into the kind of trouble it&#x27;s avoided so far.
That might explain why some 35 to 40 of the vulnerabilities it targets are found in consumer-oriented devices. These devices, Childs explains, &quot;in addition to being available and connected to the Internet, are essentially unmanaged devices and they never get updated. The vendors are producing patches, but the consumers aren&#x27;t really understanding that they need to apply the patches. People buy them and turn them on, get them working, and they never touch them again.&quot;

People with jobs, families, and other priorities can&#x27;t be expected to focus their attention on updates, or even understand how to secure all of their routers, cameras, or other miscellaneous devices. Vendors can pick up the slack by forcing security updates over-the-air (OTA) , but that solution introduces a new set of problems.
&quot;I mean, we&#x27;ve all had instances where security patches break things ,&quot; Childs points out. &quot;Consumers are afraid of security patches because they have had those negative experiences with them. So if we could get patch quality up to a level where we can trust automatic updates, especially in hardware devices like these, then yes, it should be a matter of just saying: Automatic update, go.&quot;
Even in that perfect world, though, &quot;the other problem is consumers. You&#x27;re watching a show with your family and then all of a sudden your router reboots and now your streaming service is gone and you&#x27;re frustrated. It&#x27;s difficult to find a time when you can automatically update without inconveniencing the end user,&quot; he explains.
These considerations and more complicate the patching process, Childs says, &quot;but it can be done. It&#x27;s just about finding a way to do it that&#x27;s not inconvenient, and is of quality, which is very difficult.&quot;

The Fight Against Ransomware Heats Up on the Factory Floor The Fight Against Ransomware Heats Up on the Factory Floor The Fight Against Ransomware Heats Up on the Factory Floor
Ransomware gangs continue to set their sights on the manufacturing industry, but companies are taking steps to protect themselves, starting with implementing timely patch management protocols.
October 10, 2025
Ransomware groups come and go, but one constant is that manufacturing remains a top target.
The ransomware landscape is ever-evolving. New groups emerge and old ones dismantle or rebrand. Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) launched and lowered the barrier to entry. Even the name &quot;ransomware&quot; doesn&#x27;t always apply now, as some groups rely solely on data extortion threats over encryption to pressure victims into paying. And, of course, attackers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI).
The manufacturing industry continues to take the brunt of ransomware attacks. Black Kite&#x27;s &quot;2025 Manufacturing Research Report&quot; found that manufacturing was the No. 1 target for ransomware groups four years in a row. The sector accounted for 22% of all reported attacks between April 2024 and March 2025, 1,314 attacks out of a total of 6,046, according to the report.
While researchers discovered that newer ransomware groups favored smaller companies, large manufacturing enterprises were still highly targeted.
&quot;Cybercriminals are not attacking indiscriminately; they are deliberately targeting this industry because they know its operational continuity is critical and any disruption can cause a cascading effect through global supply chains,&quot; the Black Kite report states.

Additional reports echoed the same concerns. Dragos&#x27; &quot; Industrial Ransomware Analysis: Q2 2025 &quot; says that manufacturing continued to be the most impacted sector, accounting for 65% of incidents recorded in Q2. BitSight&#x27;s &quot; State of the Underground 2025 &quot; reveals that the manufacturing sector was the most targeted for the third year in a row.
Security Gaps Make an Attractive Target
Threats to critical infrastructure are at all-time high, and the manufacturing industry is no exception, says Sarah Cleveland, senior director of federal strategy at ExtraHop. Manufacturing environments have massive attack surfaces thanks to global supply chains, remote access requirements, and the convergence of IT and operational technology (OT). They are uniquely difficult to secure because they often combine decades-old OT with modern IT and Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and many production systems were not designed with cybersecurity in mind, Cleveland explains.
&quot;Attacks across the board are hiding in encrypted channels and legitimate protocols to move unnoticed, laterally across the network, then remain dormant — waiting for the right time to strike,&quot; Cleveland tells Dark Reading.
These security gaps make manufacturing an attractive target for ransomware gangs, and emerging AI advances could worsen the problem.

&quot;Just as we are using AI to automate and accelerate workflows, attackers are using AI to improve their success rates by being able to quickly adjust their tactics to include sophisticated double extortion, exfiltration, and disabling endpoint defenses to prolong their presence before encryption,&quot; she says. &quot;Ransomware threat actors will continue to find manufacturing an especially profitable target.&quot;
Disruption Means Payday for Attackers
Manufacturing plays a critical role in global supply chains, states Ekrem Selcuk Celik, threat researcher at Black Kite. Unplanned downtime in manufacturing can lead to substantial financial losses and supply chain shortages. Recent attacks, like the one against Asahi Breweries, highlights how disruptive ransomware is for the industry — and how ransomware groups rely on disruption to elicit payments.
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) also suffered a recent cyberattack , which erupted into a month-long disruption. While JLR did not confirm it was caused by ransomware, Xcape board member Damon Small says the attack smacks of ransomware.
&quot;Volumes have been impacted since the start of September by the recent cyber incident, with production stoppages impacting wholesales,&quot; he says, pointing to the company&#x27;s Q2 fiscal 2026 report .

Threat actors love money and hate long negotiations, so they look for victims who can pay fast, says Celik. Enter: manufacturing.
&quot;Many companies, facing not only production and data loss but also the risk of becoming the source of a third-party breach, choose to pay rather than fight,&quot; Celik says. &quot;Every second of downtime equals financial loss, and attackers know it.&quot;
When selecting a target, threat groups may attempt to determine the company&#x27;s willingness to pay a ransom based on factors like potential lost revenue, says Scott Walsh, principal security researcher at Coalition. The insurer&#x27;s &quot; 2025 Cyber Claims Report &quot; found that businesses in the industrial sector experienced a 4% year-over-year increase in claims frequency in 2024.
&quot;For some organizations, it may be more cost-effective to pay the ransom than suffer the business interruption, and threat actors are aware of this,&quot; Walsh tells Dark Reading.
Is Manufacturing Inherently Insecure?
Like other experts, Walsh agrees that manufacturers are key targets given their criticality to the supply chain. However, rather than systems being inherently difficult to secure, security is held back by a manufacturing model that calls for consistency and incentives that reward keeping the core business operating, he says. A static production line will be at odds with cybersecurity, but new vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered and need to be remediated, Walsh explains.
&quot;When a producer doesn&#x27;t patch a vulnerability, they&#x27;re trading a small amount of downtime to apply patches for a much larger potential future disruption due to a cyberattack,&quot; he says.
Black Kite&#x27;s recent report points to patch management as the weakest link. The way manufacturing environments are designed makes it difficult to patch or segment without disrupting operations, which manufacturers can&#x27;t afford, particularly if the company is related to food production or logistics, which could affect national security.
However, every unpatched system and outdated server becomes an open invitation to threat actors, Celik warns.
&quot;Seventy-five percent of manufacturers have critical vulnerabilities, and 65% have at least one CISA KEV [Known Exploited Vulnerability] actively exploited today, not tomorrow,&quot; Celik says. &quot;Fixing patch management must be the first priority.&quot;
&#x27;The Trend Will Continue&#x27;
In addition to timely patch management protocols, Cleveland urges manufacturers to prioritize network visibility across both IT and OT environments, beginning with strong network segmentation and rapid detection of lateral movement.
&quot;Multifactor authentication, least-privilege access, and adherence to zero-trust principles are also essential to reduce insider and external threats, especially across the full supply chain if a partner or vendor is breached,&quot; she recommends.
Proactive third-party risk management is also vital to combat growing threats against manufacturers. Every day, new and smaller ransomware groups emerge, spending all their time looking for one weak link in the chain to break, Celik says.
&quot;Until these gaps are closed across entire supply chains,&quot; he says, &quot;the trend will continue.&quot;

The ransomware landscape is ever-evolving. New groups emerge and old ones dismantle or rebrand. Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) launched and lowered the barrier to entry. Even the name &quot;ransomware&quot; doesn&#x27;t always apply now, as some groups rely solely on data extortion threats over encryption to pressure victims into paying. And, of course, attackers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI).
The manufacturing industry continues to take the brunt of ransomware attacks. Black Kite&#x27;s &quot;2025 Manufacturing Research Report&quot; found that manufacturing was the No. 1 target for ransomware groups four years in a row. The sector accounted for 22% of all reported attacks between April 2024 and March 2025, 1,314 attacks out of a total of 6,046, according to the report.
While researchers discovered that newer ransomware groups favored smaller companies, large manufacturing enterprises were still highly targeted.
&quot;Cybercriminals are not attacking indiscriminately; they are deliberately targeting this industry because they know its operational continuity is critical and any disruption can cause a cascading effect through global supply chains,&quot; the Black Kite report states.

Additional reports echoed the same concerns. Dragos&#x27; &quot; Industrial Ransomware Analysis: Q2 2025 &quot; says that manufacturing continued to be the most impacted sector, accounting for 65% of incidents recorded in Q2. BitSight&#x27;s &quot; State of the Underground 2025 &quot; reveals that the manufacturing sector was the most targeted for the third year in a row.
Security Gaps Make an Attractive Target
Threats to critical infrastructure are at all-time high, and the manufacturing industry is no exception, says Sarah Cleveland, senior director of federal strategy at ExtraHop. Manufacturing environments have massive attack surfaces thanks to global supply chains, remote access requirements, and the convergence of IT and operational technology (OT). They are uniquely difficult to secure because they often combine decades-old OT with modern IT and Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and many production systems were not designed with cybersecurity in mind, Cleveland explains.
&quot;Attacks across the board are hiding in encrypted channels and legitimate protocols to move unnoticed, laterally across the network, then remain dormant — waiting for the right time to strike,&quot; Cleveland tells Dark Reading.
These security gaps make manufacturing an attractive target for ransomware gangs, and emerging AI advances could worsen the problem.

&quot;Just as we are using AI to automate and accelerate workflows, attackers are using AI to improve their success rates by being able to quickly adjust their tactics to include sophisticated double extortion, exfiltration, and disabling endpoint defenses to prolong their presence before encryption,&quot; she says. &quot;Ransomware threat actors will continue to find manufacturing an especially profitable target.&quot;
Disruption Means Payday for Attackers
Manufacturing plays a critical role in global supply chains, states Ekrem Selcuk Celik, threat researcher at Black Kite. Unplanned downtime in manufacturing can lead to substantial financial losses and supply chain shortages. Recent attacks, like the one against Asahi Breweries, highlights how disruptive ransomware is for the industry — and how ransomware groups rely on disruption to elicit payments.
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) also suffered a recent cyberattack , which erupted into a month-long disruption. While JLR did not confirm it was caused by ransomware, Xcape board member Damon Small says the attack smacks of ransomware.
&quot;Volumes have been impacted since the start of September by the recent cyber incident, with production stoppages impacting wholesales,&quot; he says, pointing to the company&#x27;s Q2 fiscal 2026 report .

Threat actors love money and hate long negotiations, so they look for victims who can pay fast, says Celik. Enter: manufacturing.
&quot;Many companies, facing not only production and data loss but also the risk of becoming the source of a third-party breach, choose to pay rather than fight,&quot; Celik says. &quot;Every second of downtime equals financial loss, and attackers know it.&quot;
When selecting a target, threat groups may attempt to determine the company&#x27;s willingness to pay a ransom based on factors like potential lost revenue, says Scott Walsh, principal security researcher at Coalition. The insurer&#x27;s &quot; 2025 Cyber Claims Report &quot; found that businesses in the industrial sector experienced a 4% year-over-year increase in claims frequency in 2024.
&quot;For some organizations, it may be more cost-effective to pay the ransom than suffer the business interruption, and threat actors are aware of this,&quot; Walsh tells Dark Reading.
Is Manufacturing Inherently Insecure?
Like other experts, Walsh agrees that manufacturers are key targets given their criticality to the supply chain. However, rather than systems being inherently difficult to secure, security is held back by a manufacturing model that calls for consistency and incentives that reward keeping the core business operating, he says. A static production line will be at odds with cybersecurity, but new vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered and need to be remediated, Walsh explains.
&quot;When a producer doesn&#x27;t patch a vulnerability, they&#x27;re trading a small amount of downtime to apply patches for a much larger potential future disruption due to a cyberattack,&quot; he says.
Black Kite&#x27;s recent report points to patch management as the weakest link. The way manufacturing environments are designed makes it difficult to patch or segment without disrupting operations, which manufacturers can&#x27;t afford, particularly if the company is related to food production or logistics, which could affect national security.
However, every unpatched system and outdated server becomes an open invitation to threat actors, Celik warns.
&quot;Seventy-five percent of manufacturers have critical vulnerabilities, and 65% have at least one CISA KEV [Known Exploited Vulnerability] actively exploited today, not tomorrow,&quot; Celik says. &quot;Fixing patch management must be the first priority.&quot;
&#x27;The Trend Will Continue&#x27;
In addition to timely patch management protocols, Cleveland urges manufacturers to prioritize network visibility across both IT and OT environments, beginning with strong network segmentation and rapid detection of lateral movement.
&quot;Multifactor authentication, least-privilege access, and adherence to zero-trust principles are also essential to reduce insider and external threats, especially across the full supply chain if a partner or vendor is breached,&quot; she recommends.
Proactive third-party risk management is also vital to combat growing threats against manufacturers. Every day, new and smaller ransomware groups emerge, spending all their time looking for one weak link in the chain to break, Celik says.
&quot;Until these gaps are closed across entire supply chains,&quot; he says, &quot;the trend will continue.&quot;

Feds Shutter ShinyHunters Salesforce Extortion Site Feds Shutter ShinyHunters Salesforce Extortion Site Feds Shutter ShinyHunters Salesforce Extortion Site
The group warned that law-enforcement crackdowns are imminent in the wake of the takedown, but its extortion threats against Salesforce victims remain active.
October 10, 2025
NEWS BRIEF
Last night, the FBI, in coordination with law enforcement in France, seized the latest version of the BreachForums’ underground forum domain , which was converted earlier this month into an extortion site used by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, the gang behind the recent high-profile spate of Salesforce data heists.
Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is an apparent combination of the Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and ShinyHunters cybercriminal groups that first emerged this past summer. It has been busy compromising Salesforce data , and claims that Salesforce victims have up until midnight Eastern Time today, Oct. 10, to meet its ransom demands before it will start publishing the stolen records.
Despite the BreachForums site being taken down, the group&#x27;s Tor Dark Web site is still accessible, and will be used to leak the data, the threat actors claimed.
Aside from Salesforce data, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claims to have 1 billion records and 39 victim organizations listed on the site with sample data, such as Chanel, Disney and Hulu, Marriot, Google, Toyota, FedEx, and many more.
For its part, Salesforce has issued its own statement , acknowledging the extortion attempts and reiterating that there is no indication that the Salesforce platform itself had been compromised.
BreachForums Underground Forum Closes for Good?
Visitors to the BreachForums site will now find only a seizure notice with US and French law enforcement logos on display, with links to breachforums#fbi.gov and breachforums.ic3.gov. According to the cybercriminal group, the authorities also compromised BreachForums database backups, which date back to 2023, alongside the escrow databases; and the back-end server were seized and destroyed.
In a message the group put out, it noted that no members have been arrested, but that the &quot;era of forums&quot; is over.
&quot;Over the years, BreachForums has undergone significant turbulence,&quot; said the group in its message, according to reports. &quot;To my count this is the 4th time, including RaidForums seizure that the FBI has took action, consistently. We are not fighting this war anymore, this is officially the end.&quot;
As for now, ShinyHunters has no plans to launch another iteration of BreachForums and stated that, should it ever reemerge, it should be considered a &quot;honeypot.&quot;
It added, &quot;For your own safety, security, and sanity keep your opsec in check,&quot; it said. &quot;I have no doubt the FBI and other international partners involved will be cracking down on many individuals in the next coming few weeks to months.&quot;

Chinese Hackers Use Velociraptor IR Tool in Ransomware Attacks Chinese Hackers Use Velociraptor IR Tool in Ransomware Attacks Chinese Hackers Use Velociraptor IR Tool in Ransomware Attacks
In a new wrinkle for adversary tactics, the Storm-2603 threat group is abusing the digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool to gain persistent access to victim networks.
October 10, 2025
A China-based threat group known as Storm-2603 has added a new weapon to its hacking arsenal.
Cisco Talos researchers observed Storm-2603 abusing Velociraptor, an open source digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool, in a recent ransomware attack. The open source project, which was acquired by Rapid7 in 2021, was designed by security researcher Michael Cohen to assist incident response teams with endpoint monitoring and investigations. However, it seems attackers have turned the tables on defenders and are now leveraging Velociraptor to conceal their malicious activity.
Storm-2603 initially burst on to the threat landscape in July as one of several threat groups exploiting a set of SharePoint vulnerabilities in an attack chain known as &quot;ToolShell.&quot; There, the threat actors gained access to SharePoint servers, moved laterally in the victims&#x27; networks, and deployed Warlock ransomware . In a blog post published Thursday, Cisco Talos researchers said they responded to a different incident in August, in which threat actors dropped three different types of ransomware on the victim&#x27;s VMware ESXi servers — Warlock, LockBit, and Babuk — and caused severe disruption to the organization.
In addition to the ransomware trio, Cisco Talos found Storm-2603 actors had also deployed Velociraptor to aid their attack. It was a shift in strategy; the researchers noted that the tool had not been definitively tied to ransomware attacks prior to August.

&quot;Velociraptor played a significant role in this campaign, ensuring the actors maintained stealthy persistent access while deploying LockBit and Babuk ransomware,&quot; the researchers wrote. &quot;After gaining initial access, the actors installed an outdated version of Velociraptor (version 0.73.4.0) that was exposed to a privilege escalation vulnerability ( CVE-2025-6264 ) that could lead to arbitrary command execution and endpoint takeover.&quot;
Dark Reading contacted Cisco Talos for additional information on the attack, but the company declined to comment.
Velociraptor Bites Back in Storm-2603 Attacks
Cisco Talos&#x27; blog post cited previous research from Sophos in August that first documented abuse of Velociraptor by suspected ransomware actors. Sophos Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers responded to an incident that month that they said would have likely resulted in ransomware deployment, if not for an alert from Secureworks &#x27; Taegis platform.
&quot;In this incident, the threat actor used the tool to download and execute Visual Studio Code with the likely intention of creating a tunnel to an attacker-controlled command and control (C2) server,&quot; the CTU research team wrote. &quot;Enabling the tunnel option in Visual Studio Code triggered a Taegis alert, as this option can allow both remote access and remote code execution, and has been abused by multiple threat groups in the past.&quot;

Rafe Pilling, director of threat intelligence at Sophos CTU, tells Dark Reading that the Storm-2603 activity outlined by Cisco Talos &quot;involves the same threat group and tactics&quot; as Sophos CTU researchers observed in August. Pilling says the earliest detection of Velociraptor abuse Sophos found dates to Aug. 5.
&quot;After we published our Aug. 26 blog on the use of Velociraptor by Warlock ( Gold Salem as we track them, also known as Storm-2603), the group switched to using a new C2 domain on Cloudflare&#x27;s workers.dev service,&quot; he says. &quot;We continued to see indications of the use of Velociraptor in their attacks in the first two weeks of September, but not since then.&quot;
In a follow-up post on Sept. 17, Sophos said some of these intrusions ended with the deployment of Warlock ransomware. &quot;When investigating this activity, we encountered a number of customers who had deployed Velociraptor widely across their networks, although these installations look different in our data than the malicious use by Gold Salem/Warlock,&quot; Pilling says.

Specifically, the threat actors were targeting Microsoft SharePoint servers and using Msiexec, a command line tool, to install Velociraptor. Pilling says the malicious activity was caught through behavioral detections in the Sophos Endpoint platform.
Detecting &amp; Mitigating Velociraptor DFIR Misuse
In their August report, Sophos CTU researchers said the Velociraptor abuse illustrates how threat actors are shifting to incident response tools to establish a persistent foothold in victim networks. Cisco Talos agreed, noting that the addition of Velociraptor to ransomware gangs&#x27; playbooks meshes with the company&#x27;s findings in the Talos 2024 &quot;Year in Review&quot; report, which warned that threat actors are increasingly abusing legitimate commercial and open source products for their attacks.
Cisco Talos cited guidance from Rapid7 for identifying and mitigating potential Velociraptor abuse, which notes that the tool deliberately creates &quot;easy to detect&quot; indicators of compromise (IoCs) if misused. Rapid7 acknowledged that since Velociraptor is open source, attackers can modify the tool to remove the generation of the IoCs, but the company said such binaries will either be unsigned or signed by another entity besides Rapid7, and therefore should be flagged.
Rapid7 responded to the reported attacks in a blog post on Thursday. &quot;Rapid7 has implemented detections for this and other Velociraptor-related misuse, and is not impacted by this incident,&quot; Christiaan Beek, Rapid7&#x27;s senior director of threat analytics, wrote.
Beek noted that in the activity observed by Sophos CTU researchers, the threat actors downloaded a Velociraptor binary and specified a C2 server in the configuration file. Once it was deployed on a compromised system, the attackers used Velociraptor to establish communications with the C2 server as well as download additional files and execute commands on the system.
&quot;This behavior reflects a misuse pattern rather than a software flaw: adversaries simply repurpose legitimate collection and orchestration capabilities,&quot; Beek wrote.
Organizations should check to see if the Velociraptor instances in their environments are legitimate, and analyze endpoint logs for any newly created services or scheduled tasks tied to &quot;velociraptor.exe,&quot; Beek said. Additionally, security teams should restrict the execution of any unknown Velociraptor binaries.

Chinese Hackers Use Velociraptor IR Tool in Ransomware Attacks Chinese Hackers Use Velociraptor IR Tool in Ransomware Attacks Chinese Hackers Use Velociraptor IR Tool in Ransomware Attacks
In a new wrinkle for adversary tactics, the Storm-2603 threat group is abusing the digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool to gain persistent access to victim networks.
October 10, 2025
A China-based threat group known as Storm-2603 has added a new weapon to its hacking arsenal.
Cisco Talos researchers observed Storm-2603 abusing Velociraptor, an open source digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool, in a recent ransomware attack. The open source project, which was acquired by Rapid7 in 2021, was designed by security researcher Michael Cohen to assist incident response teams with endpoint monitoring and investigations.

Microsoft Adds Agentic AI Capabilities to Sentinel Microsoft Adds Agentic AI Capabilities to Sentinel Microsoft Adds Agentic AI Capabilities to Sentinel
Microsoft previewed the Sentinel security graph and MCP server at its annual Microsoft Secure virtual event earlier this month.
October 10, 2025
Microsoft is expanding its Sentinel security information and event management (SIEM) offering into a broad security operations and management platform with the launch of new graph capabilities and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
The new capabilities for Sentinel, revealed last week at the company&#x27;s annual Microsoft Secure virtual event, promise to bring agentic artificial intelligence (AI) functionality that can accelerate an organization&#x27;s ability to detect and remediate threats and relieve overwhelmed security teams.
The new graph tools will enable Security Copilot agents to more precisely and rapidly investigate and respond to threats. Meanwhile, the Sentinel MCP Server will facilitate the integration of third-party and internally developed agents.
&quot;Sentinel MCP server enables extensibility for pre-defined and custom agents, allowing AI-powered reasoning over unified data,&quot; wrote Microsoft corporate VP for security Vasu Jakkal in a blog post. &quot;This shifts security from reactive to predictive, helping teams anticipate threats and automate response at scale.&quot;
Like many of its key competitors, including Cisco, CrowdStrike, and Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft has been moving to extend its SIEM into a broad security operations platform. The recently launched products expand on the July launch of Microsoft Sentinel Data Lake, an integrated data lake designed to store an unlimited amount of log files and other security data.
Related: The Cloud Edge Is the New Attack Surface
Microsoft is expanding the integration of agents and other security platforms with the launch of its new Microsoft Security Store. Among the early launch partners are Accenture, Darktrace, IBM, Illumio, ServiceNow, Simbian, and Zscaler.
Deepen Desai, Zscaler&#x27;s CSO and executive VP for cyber and AI engineering, notes that Microsoft can already leverage Zscaler&#x27;s cloud security telemetry to perform threat hunting and enrich investigations.
&quot;We are now expanding the capabilities and partnership in this space to include Microsoft Sentinel&#x27;s new data lake capabilities, which will unlock deeper insight and faster response for our joint customers,&quot; Densai says.
The ability to enable agents to take on threat discovery analysis is becoming increasingly critical as organizations&#x27; SecOps teams are overwhelmed by the volume of threats that are exposed, says Scott Crawford, research director for information security at S&amp;P Global&#x27;s 451 Research. Crawford&#x27;s latest research shows that SOC teams can handle only roughly half of all alerts in a typical day, and that percentage has been climbing steadily over the past five years.
Related: An NVIDIA Container Bug &amp; Chance to Harden Kubernetes
&quot;Just having help with the ability to triage all that information is overwhelming for SOC teams, and these innovations are intended to help alleviate that burden and identify events that merit a prioritized response,&quot; Crawford says. &quot;Bringing together those telemetry sources, normalizing and correlating them, and servicing those that are of the highest priority helps organizations gain a better handle on their data overload.&quot;
In March, Microsoft announced added agentic AI capabilities to Security Copilot with the launch of autonomous agents. Since then, Microsoft has released over a dozen agents designed to address situations such as phishing triage and optimizing conditional access, Jakkal notes.
Greater Scale and More Predictive Scope
Microsoft has offered security graph capability for over a decade, but the addition of the Sentinel Data Lake will enable greater scale.
&quot;The data lake concept is designed to unify telemetry better and apply normalization rationalization to data and expose it primarily to Sentinel in ways that are more directly consumable,&quot; Crawford says.
Scott Woodgate, general manager of threat detection at Microsoft, gave Dark Reading a demo of the new graph capability viewed in the Microsoft Defender portal. In the scenario, a hypothetical employee named &quot;Natasha&quot; was the victim of a password spray attack. Woodgate demonstrated how the Sentinel graph can help predict where the attacker might go further.
Related: AWS Enhances Cloud Security With Better Visibility Features
&quot;The graph gives you visibility into the relationships between people and assets. Now I can predict that the attacker is probably going to go after the SQL database or maybe the storage account,&quot; Woodgate explains. &quot;If I know that as a security team before they&#x27;ve gone there, then I can look at the key vault and determine that the permissions on that are correct before the attacker goes and figures out that they&#x27;re incorrect permissions and fix it.&quot;
Better Agent Integration and Compatibility
The Sentinel MCP Server offers a platform for Microsoft and its partners to develop agents, Woodgate says. The Azure-based server is hosted in the Microsoft Sentinel Incident Center and exposed to Sentinel via a URL. When an agent or a user calls on an MCP server, it exposes a set of new tools that Microsoft is releasing. One such tool is the Entity Analyzer, which provides more data about an attack. Another will enable natural language queries through the MCP server.
&quot;In the past, you would have done a KQL query,&quot; Woodgate says. &quot;More recently, you can do natural language queries to query data. And now you can do that through the MCP server as an agent.”
Customers and partners can also build agents in a Sentinel MCP server-enabled coding platform, such as VS Code, using GitHub Copilot, Jakkal adds.
&quot;Once built, you can refine and deploy agents to your Security Copilot workspace while keeping the process within the familiar development platform,&quot; she notes.
Microsoft&#x27;s Sentinel graph and MCP server are now available in public preview. Sentinel Data Lake, which was in preview since its July launch, is now generally available.

Microsoft has offered security graph capability for over a decade, but the addition of the Sentinel Data Lake will enable greater scale.
&quot;The data lake concept is designed to unify telemetry better and apply normalization rationalization to data and expose it primarily to Sentinel in ways that are more directly consumable,&quot; Crawford says.
Scott Woodgate, general manager of threat detection at Microsoft, gave Dark Reading a demo of the new graph capability viewed in the Microsoft Defender portal. In the scenario, a hypothetical employee named &quot;Natasha&quot; was the victim of a password spray attack. Woodgate demonstrated how the Sentinel graph can help predict where the attacker might go further.

&quot;The graph gives you visibility into the relationships between people and assets. Now I can predict that the attacker is probably going to go after the SQL database or maybe the storage account,&quot; Woodgate explains. &quot;If I know that as a security team before they&#x27;ve gone there, then I can look at the key vault and determine that the permissions on that are correct before the attacker goes and figures out that they&#x27;re incorrect permissions and fix it.&quot;
Better Agent Integration and Compatibility
The Sentinel MCP Server offers a platform for Microsoft and its partners to develop agents, Woodgate says. The Azure-based server is hosted in the Microsoft Sentinel Incident Center and exposed to Sentinel via a URL. When an agent or a user calls on an MCP server, it exposes a set of new tools that Microsoft is releasing. One such tool is the Entity Analyzer, which provides more data about an attack. Another will enable natural language queries through the MCP server.
&quot;In the past, you would have done a KQL query,&quot; Woodgate says. &quot;More recently, you can do natural language queries to query data. And now you can do that through the MCP server as an agent.”
Customers and partners can also build agents in a Sentinel MCP server-enabled coding platform, such as VS Code, using GitHub Copilot, Jakkal adds.
&quot;Once built, you can refine and deploy agents to your Security Copilot workspace while keeping the process within the familiar development platform,&quot; she notes.
Microsoft&#x27;s Sentinel graph and MCP server are now available in public preview. Sentinel Data Lake, which was in preview since its July launch, is now generally available.
